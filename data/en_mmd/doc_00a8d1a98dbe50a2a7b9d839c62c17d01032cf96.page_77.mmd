ii, the criminal and legally relevant collateral consequences of
pleading guilty: R v Wong, 2018 SCC 25, at paras 3-4
Cherrington at para 23; A v Quick, 2016 ONCA 95 at para 4

In particular, an informed guilty plea means that an accused must be aware of the
legally relevant collateral consequences. A legally relevant collateral consequence
is a consequence that bears upon sufficiently serious legal interests of the accused:
Rv Gim, 2019 ONCA 202, at para 52

In Brooks, Hourigan J.A. commented in obiter that a consequence that the plea
may impact future travel or emigration plans does not strike me as being a
sufficiently serious legal interest, as it would strain the definition to include a wide
variely of remote consequences that do not impact on an applicant's legal rights in
Canada: 2020 ONCA 60S, at para 11

Note, however, that the accused need not be aware of the precise consequences
of his plea, which may be difficult to predict: A v. Shiwprashad, 2015 ONCA 577 at
para 71

‘The appellant must show a failure to appreciate or an unawareness of a potential
penalty that is legally relevant. Legally relevant penalties would at least include
penalties imposed by the state. Thus, non-criminal “penalties” imposed by the state
for a Criminal Code offence would be “legally relevant:" v Quick, 2016 ONCA
95 at para 28 For example, the indefinite suspension of one's drivers license:
quick at para 30

However, it is unneecssary thatan informed plea requires an accused to
understand every conceivable collateral consequence of the plea, even a
consequence that might be “legally relevant’. Some of these consequences may
bbe too remote; other consequences not anticipated by the accused may not differ
significantly trom the anticipated consequences; or, the consequence itself may be
100 insignificant to affect the validity of the plea: Quick at para 31

For example, if the accused was unaware of an indefinite license suspension, but
for health reasons was unable to drive again in any event, the collateral
‘consequence would be too remote to warrant a striking of the plea: Quick at para
32

‘A simple way to measure the significance to an accused of a collateral

consequence of pleading guilly is to ask: is there a realistic likelihood that an
accused, informed of the collateral consequence of a plea, would not have pleaded
