Introduction

‘The Equality and Human Rights Commission (he Commission’) has been given
powers by Parliament to advise Government on the equality and human rights
implications of laws and proposed laws and to publish information or provide
advice, including to Parliament, on any matter related to equality, diversity and
human rights.

We support the UK Government's commitment to tackle serious crime and
promote a fair justice system.' The Commission's current strategic plan prioriises
work to enhance access to justice for women and girs surviving violence and to
improve fair trial protections in the criminal justice system. We are pleased to see
measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill (the Bill’) aimed at
feducing the increased use of custodial remand for children, as well as measures
to promote open justice and provide for the presence of a sign language:
interpreter during jury deliberations. This brieting will focus on four aspects of the
Bill wth particular equality and human rights implications.

We advise the Government to:

+ Implement the recommendations of our Criminal Justice Inquiry before
permanently expanding the use of lve link in criminal proceedings.*

‘+ Reconsider the expansion of powers to police peaceful protest, which we
consider inconsistent with Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention
on Human Rights (ECHR).

+ Reconsider measures expanding the criminalisation of trespass and
accompanying police powers which could disproportionately interfere with
the Article 8 and 14 ECHR rights of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT)

communities.

+ References to the government, ministers or departments refer to the UK
Government unless othenwise specified.
