(GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The Constitution Act, 1867 gives Parliament exclusive legislative authority over
criminal law (with the exception ofthe constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction)
under s. 91(27). Under s. 92(18) of the Constitution Act, 1867, the provinces also
have the authority to impose punishment by fine, penalty or imprisonment fr the
purpose of enforcing otherwise valid provincial laws.

To constitute criminal law, the impugned enactment requires a prohibition and a
penal consequence. In addition, the prohibition has to serve a criminal public
purpose.
