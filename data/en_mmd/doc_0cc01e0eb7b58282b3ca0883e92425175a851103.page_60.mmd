NURSE
Hello, is this the government? Please send someone
who’s already upset.

JANE
What did my arm do?!

DR. McCORVEY
Don’t blame the poor arm, you reckless little minx. I
could’ ve lost my license!

JANE
What’s going on? What are you doing?

NURSE
We'll be waiting right here. Thank you.
(She hangs up.)
They’re not sending anyone.

DR. McCORVEY
You got away with it this time, Jane. You come into
my hospital with your big dumb eyes and distracting
teeth and want me to amputate your arm while it’s
still alive?

JANE
... Are you out of procaine? I know of some creative
solutions.
