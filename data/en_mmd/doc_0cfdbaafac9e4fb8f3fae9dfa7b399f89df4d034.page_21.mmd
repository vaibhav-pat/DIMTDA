IS THERE A GENERAL GUIDELINES ON HOW THE COURT.
MIGHT DEAL WITH FAMILY ASSETS?

> The date of the trial will remain the date of the valuation of the assets. In
other words the argument that it should be different dates e.g. date of
separation/ acquisition has not been revived.

> There should be no discrimination e.g. by being a stay at home mother
and this remains, although the Courts now enquire more robustly into the
availability of work for spouses;

> Irish law did not follow the English law in applying the principle of
“Equality” between spouses. The standard to be followed is that laid
down as regards “proper provision” being made for each of the spouses
and children.

> The trial judge has a wide discretion.

> Each case depends on its particular circumstances.

We have found that as a general rule, in cases where there are sufficient
resources, most judges will do a 50/50 split of assets .

Its important to bear in mind that this is a very general yardstick and will not
apply where there is not enough to go round or where there is more than
enough .

IS IT POSSIBLE TO PROTECT YOUR ASSETS IN A
SEPARATION OR DIVORCE?

One of the ways people can try to do this preemptively, is by having a pre -
nuptial agreement setting out how the parties will divide their assets and deal
with their finances upon Divorce or Judicial Separation
