isa customer-driven operation consisting
in three main steps: i) data extraction, ie
downloading data from a source
provider's ecosystem: i) transformation,
when the data is structured in a way that
does not match the schema of the target
location; ii) upload of the data in a new
destination location. In a specific
sitwation outlined in this Regulation,
unbundling of a particular service from
the contract and moving it to another
provider shall also be considered as
‘switching. The switching process is
sometimes managed on behalf of the
customer by a third-party entity.
Accordingly, allright and obligations of
the customer established by this
Regulation, including the obligation to
collaborate in good faith, should be
understood to apply to such a third-party
entity in these circumstances. Providers of
cloud computing services and customers
have different levels of responsibilities,
depending on the steps of the process
referred to. For instance, the source
provider of data processing services is
‘responsible to extract the data to a
‘machine-readable format, but itis the
customer and the destination provider
‘who will upload the data to the new
environment, unless specif professional
transition service has been obtained.
Obstacles o switching are ofa different
nature, depending on which step of the
‘witching process is referred to.
Functional equivalence means the
possibilty to re-establish, on the basis of
the customer's data, a mivimum level of
functionality of a service in the
environment of a new data processing
service after switching, where the
destination service delivers a comparable
‘outcome in response to the same input for
