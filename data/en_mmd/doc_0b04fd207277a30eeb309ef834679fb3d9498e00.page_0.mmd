During oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, the oxidation states of two substances change.

‘oxidation =
reduction

Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

oxidizing agent (oxidant is reduced (or has a component that is reduced)

reducing agent (reductant): is oxidized (or has a component that is oxidized)
eg, — Zn{s) + 2HM(aq) >

EX, Identity the oxidant and the reductant.

2H20l) + Alls) + MnOx(aq) > AI(OH)r(aq) + MnO2(s)

Balancing Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
conserve mass AND conserve charge
hall-teaction: oxidation by itself, or reduction by itself

EX. Write half-reactions for... Sn®(aq) + 2Fe*(aq) > Sn‘*(aq) + 2 Fe*(aq)

Inline notation, this reaction would be writen:
