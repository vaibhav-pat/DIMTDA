Area response and Community Policing Teams. Where their proactive use of drugs
wipes at the road side will have maximum impact upon disrupting local drug related
harm

‘A recent study undertaken by the SERP RTC data analyst studied 231 Athena
custody references which identified 6% of drug drivers had been arrested on at
least one previous occasion and 48% had been arrested for offences indicative of a
criminal ifestyle. With those linked to violence making up the largest group.

The data highlights 98% of those arrested were male and predominantly aged in
their 20's,

The table below highlights the monthly arrests for drug driving comparing 2017 to
2018.

This steady increase in arrests for drug driving is reflected in data from across the
country and potentially highlights a lack of educational awareness around this,
specific area of risk. It is therefore a priority for SERP partners to fully understand
this area of road safety and look to fully embed within their educational engagement
‘opportunities and road safety campaigns scheduled for 2019.

The results from the initial piece of analytical work conducted around 231 offenders
from Athena has provided Roads Policing with further evidence on how proactive

enforcement ofthis legislation can also have a positive impact upon disrupting
criminality and, in particular, those linked to illegal drug supply and violence.
