‘considered at the FROSTYs meeting held in November 2016 and agreed that they were a
‘tue record of last year's AGM.

Chair's Report
Chair presented his annual report which was passed as a true account of activities.

The Committee offered their thanks to all who had supported FROSTYS or helped to run
‘events during the previous 12 months and in particular to Jo Smiles, the library committee
and summer fair helpers. A highlight of the year had been the skype assembly delivered by
Michael Rosen. It was noted that more parents had been involved in FROSTYS events such
{as the summer fair than ever before.

It was noted that this may be the final year that the Shine programme would run at St
Teresa's due to changes in Hallé orchestra funding: the school was exploring other funding
options.
