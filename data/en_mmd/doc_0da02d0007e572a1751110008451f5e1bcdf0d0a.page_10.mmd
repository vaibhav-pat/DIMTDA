Circle Time

During circle time the children in each group sit together with their teacher. The
central idea in Circle Time is that the children are all together as a group and
talking. This is an ideal opportunity for children to:

+Learn to listen to each other
+ Voice their opinions

+ Tell stories

+Learn about each other

+ Develop their language skills
+ Introduce new activities,

+ Share stories or ideas

+ Ask questions
