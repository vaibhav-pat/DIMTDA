‘operate normally even if 5. were removed. This would be the same as my understanding of

isolability, f normal operation were understood in terms of performing input-output mappings,

Dut i isa very different notion if understood in terms of producing the

ormal outputs. Si might
receive indispensable inputs feom Ss, in which ase, the removal ofthe latter would prevent the
former from operating normally, ie. from producing its normal outputs. Sand Se might,

however, still be isolable from each other, in that even though S; needs inputs from Ss, Si till

capable of perform

its inpuvoutput mapping without S2: ie. Si could, if given the inputs it
would normally have received from S2, produce the appropriate outputs without further

assistance from $2, I'm not sure that t

s how Carruthers intends dissociability; perhaps he has

something more like my isolablity in mind. In any case, this contrast illustrates the proper

understanding of isoability and the theory of modularity that incorporates it

‘Suppose perception is cognitively penetra

by beliefs, desires, and the like. Then the
‘perceptual systems are receiving input from higher cognitive mechanisms and are therefore not

‘encapsulated. This

not by itself any threat to the existence of perceptual modules, however, for
itis no threat to the isolability of the substrates responsible for perception. It may be thatthe

season beliefs influence perceptio

is that there is really no distinction between the module
responsible for those beliefs and the module responsible for perceptual states, i. that belief-

production and pereept-formation are both part of the task of a single, indivisible module. But

another potential eason is tht, although perceptual modules are dist

«from belief-forming

systems, the former receive inputs from the later. The mere fact of top-down influence (i.e.,on

perception, from beliefs, ete.) is compatible with ether possibility. Even ifthe inputs were
indispensable, in the sense that the perceptual systems would be incapable of producing percepts

without input from higher cognition, this would not threaten the dist

ness of the perceptual
