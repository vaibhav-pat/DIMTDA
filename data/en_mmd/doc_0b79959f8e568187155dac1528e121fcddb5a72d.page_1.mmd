Abstract
It remains controversial whether touch is a truly spatial sense or not. Many philosophers
suggest that, if touch is indeed spatial, it is only through its alliances with exploratory

movement, and with proprioception. Here we develop the noti

that a minimal yet
important form of spatial perception may occur in purely passive touch. We do this by

showing thatthe array of tactile receptive fields in the skin, and appropriately relayed to the

cortex, may contain the same basie informational building blocks that a creature navi

xing
to build up a perception of space. We illustrate this point with
preliminary evidence that perception of spatiotemporal patterns on the human skin shows

some of the same features as spatial navigation in animals. We argue (a) that the receptor

jeld exists in a minimal form

array defines a ‘tactile field’, (b) that this “skin space’,

logically prior to any transformation into bodily or external spatial coordinates, and (c) that
