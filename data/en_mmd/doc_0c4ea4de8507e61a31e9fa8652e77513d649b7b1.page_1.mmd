(1) To assess the real impact of the proposed Technical and Vocational Education and
Training (TVET) system budget cuts, itis important that the earmarked budget provided by
National Treasury for the purpose of implementing the TVET Post Provisioning Norms
(PPN) be excluded from the baseline increase, as itis actualy being subsidised through a
baseline reduction from the TVET Direct Transfers (subsidies). The PPN allocation is,
theretore in real terms not a baseline increase, as the TVET sector and public TVET
colleges wil receive no adaitional funding for this purpose in particular.

The following table reflects in real terms the proposed budget reduction for the TVET
sector over the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), which excludes the PPN:
