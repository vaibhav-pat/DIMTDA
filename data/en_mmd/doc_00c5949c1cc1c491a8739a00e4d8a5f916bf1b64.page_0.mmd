John Dallesasse
(Academic Senate)

support this recommendation. With an inereasing number of electrie vehicles
parking on campus, having a plan to appropriately support these vehicles is needed,
The task force should look into issues that not only impact people commuting to
campus, but also issues with supporting EVs that are part of the campus fleet of
Vehicles. The breadth of issues spans requirements and cost associated with
charging, any special safety considerations in charging locations, etc
