Current Work and Performance

Traffic Collisions Casualty D: riously Injured (KSI

In 2018 there has been a slight reduction in the number of people seriously injured
following a road traffic colision in comparison to 2017 but there has been a very
slight rise in the number of people killed.

Year | Fatal | Serious | Total
2018, 47) 864) O11"
2017/45) 881) 927

Provisional

The attached appendix sets out in more detail performance linked to various road
user groups throughout 2018, This concludes that whilst we have seen a reduction in
the number of motor cycle casualties during 2018, concern remain around car driver
behaviour and, in particular, with young drivers aged between 16-25, car occupant
casualties, cyclists and pedestrians.

oe

A study is being carried out by the Safer Essex Roads RTC data analyst into fatal
road traffic collisions and will examine in more detail contributory factors behind each
collsion resulting in a fatality.

This study may also provide a greater understanding behind what has been an
exceptionally challenging year for the Serious Collsion Investigation Unit.

During 2018 when compared to 2017, this small team of Detectives within Roads

Policing Command has seen a 62% increase in the number of fatal or life changing
road traffic collision investigations which identify a prosecution.
