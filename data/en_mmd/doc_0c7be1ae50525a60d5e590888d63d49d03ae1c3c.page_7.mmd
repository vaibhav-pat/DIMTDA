4.1.13, Impact of implementation from analysis by 3GPP RANS (See Annex 3)
3GPP RAN4 reviewed the implementation feasibility to meet lower unwanted emission level
than the baseline value for spurious emissions of both IMT base station (BS) and mobile station
(UE) as Total Radiated Power (TRP) provided by WP 5D as -I3dBnvMHz (equal to -
204BW/200MHz). If stringent unwanted emission level lower than -37dBW/200MHz for IMT
BS is required, it can be achievable with following conditions:

‘+ More than 1-SGHz guard band

+ 3-4.dB insertion loss, ie causing a 20% performance reduction in cell edge of IMT

4.1.2, Fixed-Satellite Service in the band 24.65 - 25.25GHz and 27 - 27.5GH2z

4.1.2.1. Summary of technical conditions

‘The following four technical conditions are selected forthe consideration of technical aspects.
‘+ Maximum TRP of IMT base stations with range of [25/35/37/46/TBD] dBm/200 MHz
