EARLY EVENING - Veranda

Jack and Elena are seen enjoying their customary McCallum 12 while Ethan
pulls on his vape pen.

“So, what's this book you can't put down?” Asks Ethan

Elena holds up the cover. It read, Fireball: Carole Lombard and the Mystery of
Flight 3

Carole Lombard? Asked Jack

“So, check it out. The author, this guy Matzen, says that somewhere in between
her eight marriages, our own Ms. Lana Turner managed to have multiple affairs,
not the least among them, one Clark Gable.

HmmAh but wait, there's more! According to this guy, her neighbors at the time ~
probably from that house right there if| had to guess..." (She points up the hil),
“reportedly saw her and Gable engaged in a litle synchronized nude swimming
on several occasions."

-“Wait..are you saying Gable swam in our pool? Jack asked
“It appears so."

“So, what does that have to do with Lombard?” asked Ethan,
“Because Lombard was married to Gable atthe time.”

“So did she ever know about it?”

“Oh yea, she knew. According to this guy and apparently Gable himself. They
fought about it the night before she died.”

“Ahh, | remember, Lombard died in a plane crash, right?”

“She did. So the story goes, she took a smaller, less safe plane in order to hurry
‘back to her husband and try to patch things up — hence the title, Flight 3.

So000... that probably means that this houses previous owner, Ms. Lana Turner,
‘somewhere between her eight marriages, and maybe that very night, was fucking
Clark Gable, right there in that pool.”
