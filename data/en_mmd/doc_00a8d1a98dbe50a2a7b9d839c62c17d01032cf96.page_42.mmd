trial counsel's attempts to defend against claims of ineffectiveness: A v Trought,
2021 ONCA 379, at paras 76-78

lil, EvibenTiany FOUNDATION

‘The appeal record on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel typically includes
the affidavit and cross-examination of trial counsel. While the Practice
Direction does not specifically require it, an affidavit is expected because it will
‘almost certainly become the central document in any ineffective assistance claim:

Either the Crown or the defence might elicit trial counsel's affidavit. However, this
responsibilty will often fall to the Grown as a practical matter because trial counsel
is nota party to the appeal. Par of the court's concern is to ensure that trial counsel
whose professional conduct is being impugned has an opportunity to explain the
strategic and other decisions made during the course of the tral

‘The Protocol contemplates that the court will have before it ll available information
relating to the allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Trial counsel's,
version of the relevant events is obviously crucial. This court expects that trial
counsel will fully address the allegations made by the appellant.

However, the Crown is not compelled to seek out and file trial counsel's
affidavit. To the contrary, an appellant's failure to fully engage in the process
established by the Practice Direction permits the court to draw an adverse
inference about the true value of the evidence that the appellant argues would
have changed the course of the trial. The appellant's reluctance to follow the
procedure can be seen as an admission that the more robust fact-finding process
of the Practice Direction, including an affidavit by trial counsel and cross-
‘examination, might weaken rather than strengthen the claim of ineffective
assistance: R v Earle, 2021 ONCA 34, at paras 66-69
