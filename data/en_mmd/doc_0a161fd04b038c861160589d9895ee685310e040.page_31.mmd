Priority Area 3: Employment

Why is this important?

Competitive and integrated employment ~ and the access to stable housing that it can bring —is a
key pathway to the middle class. For people with disabilities, also increases connections to the
‘community, builds self-confidence and ean lower rates of isolation and depression. The District
gains much from the perspectives and talents people with disabilities bring to the workforce, in
‘addition to their positive impact on the economy in wages earned, taxes paid, and goods and
services purchased.

What is the Vision?
