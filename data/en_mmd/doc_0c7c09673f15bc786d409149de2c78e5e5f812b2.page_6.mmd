42 Data Fusion Sim

fon Experiment

‘There ate thee cases ia the simulation. They all expeiznce stabilization period,
lstubance period and seturning stabilization perio,

‘Case 1: Only use SCADA data to estinate state
‘Case 2 Estimate state without WAMSISCADA data
‘Case 3 Etimate state alter WAMSISCADA dt fusion

‘The inal results ae showed with estimated standard deviton after sate estimation,
Ccase3 use the coutlation coefficient in some pevod wo make that is the datum
When they ae ot synchronous, the diflerences of dat's stubization will be
removed by solving curve alignment funtion.

“The simulation result is showed a Fig 2:
