ANNUALLY ~ a deep clean of all areas should be undertaken once per year. Best practice is to start from high to
low levels. Ideally, rooms should be systematically cleaned, furniture grouped at one area to allow thorough
cleaning as detailed below.

* Clean internal surfaces of kitchen units in staffroom

+ Wash or dust wall surfaces appropriate to finish to ceiling height

+ Deep clean all furniture ~ to include all surfaces e.g. underside of tables and chairs and legs.
* Clean pupilsâ€™ trays, storage trays/boxes if empty

+ Clean/dust blinds as specified

* Clean all ight fittings ~ CARETAKER

+ Remove chewing gum from all surfaces including furniture
