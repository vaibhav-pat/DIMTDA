7. CLOSING PRAYER

‘Thank you God, for your son Jesus and the special story he told Simon.
Saying "sorry" is so important for us, to have peace, joy and friendship with God.

We thank you that you will always forgive us for our bad behaviour and thoughts,
when we admit these faults to you.

‘Thank you for being our Friend. Help us to know you more and to lave other people
‘as you love them

AMEN.
