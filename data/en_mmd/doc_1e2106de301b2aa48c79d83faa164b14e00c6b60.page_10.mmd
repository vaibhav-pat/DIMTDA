In Marin County:

* Re-open the Alto Tunnel thereby connecting the
Sausalito Mill Valley Trail with the Corte Madera San
Anselmo Trail.

* Build a bicycle path between San Geronimo and Cross
Marin Trail at Samuel P. Taylor State Park.

* Build a bicycle path along Tomales Bay on the original
North Pacific Coast Railway right-of-way.

* Complete the North South Greenway from Larkspur to
Sausalito.

In addition to city bus service, shuttle service from SMART
Stations that serves State and County Parks as well as
lodging facilities in tourist areas would reduce air and noise
pollution providing an alternative to auto travel. Shuttle
schedules should be coordinated with SMART train arrivals
and departures.

The following shuttle connections to SMART stations would
reduce the need for auto travel:

* Service from the Airport and Downtown Santa Rosa
SMART station to the Russian River Valley and
Sonoma Coast including stops in Forestville, Rio Nido,
Hacienda, Guerneville, Monte Rio, Jenner, Bodega Bay,
Bodega, Freestone, Occidental and Sebastopol.
Institute a shuttle service from the Downtown Santa
Rosa SMART Station to tourist areas in the Valley of
the Moon and City of Sonoma including stops in
Oakmont, Kenwood, Glen Ellen, Boyes Hot Springs,
and wineries and tasting rooms.
Enhance the Marin Stagecoach shuttle service from the
San Rafael Transit Center to Inverness to include stops
in Samuel P. Taylor State Park.
