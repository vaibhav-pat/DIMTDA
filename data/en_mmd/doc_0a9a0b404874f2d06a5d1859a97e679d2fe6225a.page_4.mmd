commissioned instrument
within Shropshire directly
ordered from this renowned
organ builder, its only rival
being a second-hand model
installed at Loppington in 1949.
This fact achieves greater
significance when considering
that the majority of Willis
organs are found in the major
Cathedrals - Truro and
Coventry being contemporary
1887 models; within musical
establishments such as the
Albert Hall and the Royal
‘Academy of Music; and the
royal residences such as the
venue for the recent royal
wedding at St George’s Chapel,
Windsor.

Clive’s instrument contains 632
pipes which is a relatively
modest provision compared to
the enormous Cathedral
models boasting upwards of
9,500 pipes, but given the
village church location, it is
capable of delivering an
enormous repertoire. A well-
known movable organ, a ‘Willis-

on-Wheels’ which possesses an
identical specification to our
organ, is regularly used in St
Paul's Cathedral, London.
Furthermore our model has
been identified by Dr Jim
Berrow ( Organs Advisor.
Diocese of Lichfield ) as “almost
certainly the oldest working
mechanism in the district still
serving its original purpose.”

farmer, John Hall, who two
years earlier had paid £260 for
the Willis organ to be installed
in the church. The instrument
