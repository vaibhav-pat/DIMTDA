Develop insulation and draught proofing standards

RECOMMENDATION

‘= Promptly engage community and consumer
representatives in the development of an insulation

standard,
‘+ Revise minimum standard item 7 to “structurally sound,
‘weatherproof and substantially draught proof”

Insulation and draught proofing are features of healthy, comfortable homes and contribute to
keeping household energy costs down,

‘The RIS recognises that ceiling insulation and draught sealing are required as part of an
‘effective thermal response (RIS p55). However, insulation has not been included in the
‘proposed minimum standards, on the basis that DELWP will investigate options for an
insulation standard in 2020,

‘The importance of draught proofing has been recognised in proposed r28C, where renters
have the right to draught proof their property. However, by regulating draught proofing as a
‘modification right rather than a minimum standard, the responsibilty, cost and effort to
draught proof a home is likely to land on renters.

‘The proposed minimum standard 7 requires thatthe premises be ‘structurally sound and
\weatherproo?, which implies that a premises should be made draught proot to comply. This
standard could be clarified to remove ambiguity and place responsibilty for draught proofing
‘on the rental provider, rather than on the renter by modification,
