In R v Said, 2019 ONCA 378, the Court of Appeal found that the trial judge's
repeated interjections exceeded what was reasonably necessary and (1) strayed
into derisive commentary about trial counsel and (2) left the impression that she

C. BIAS IN THE REASONS.

‘The presumption of judicial integrity can be rebutted where the reasons for
conviction are delivered months later or constitute an after-the-fact amendment,

the reasoning that led to the decision: R v Arnaout, 2015 ONCA 655 at paras 19-

In the case of an after-the-fact amendment, the remedy may be to simply exclude
the post-verdict reasons and assess whether the original reasons are sufficient

+ questioning witnesses in such a way as to make it impossible for counsel to
present the defence case:
