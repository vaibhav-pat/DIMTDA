li. the review panel may intervene and substitute its decision for that of the
judge where itis satisfied the judge erred in law or in principle and the error

Neither party has a right to produce new evidence on a s. 680 review, but the
reviewing court has the discretion to receive that evidence. Fresh evidence is
routinely received on s. 680 reviews if the evidence is relevant and relates to
matters post-dating the bail decision under review.

‘The approach to fresh evidence outlined in St. Cloud applies to fresh evidence
offered on a s. 680 review: A v Jasper, 2020 ONCA 606, at paras 40-55: Rv JA,
2020 ONCA 660, at paras 27-28

C. 90 DAY REVIEW

‘The correct approach to a detention review under s. 825 is as follows. First, the
jailer has an obligation to apply for the hearing immediately upon the expiration of
‘90 days following the day on which the accused was initially taken before a justice
under s. 503. Where there is an intervening detention order under s. 520, 521 or
'524 following the initial appearance of the accused and before the end of the 90-
day period, the 90-day period begins again. Accused persons who have not had a
{ull bail hearing are nonetheless entitled to one under s. 525. Upon receiving the
application from the jailer, the judge must fix a date and give notice for the hearing,
‘The hearing must be held at the earliest opportunity.

In his or her analysis, the judge may refer to the transcript, exhibits and reasons
{rom any initial judicial interim release hearing and from any subsequent review
hearings. Both parties are also entiled to make submissions on the basis of any
additional “credible or trustworthy" information which is relevant or material to the
judge's analysis, and pre-existing material is subject to the criteria of due diligence
and relevance discussed in St-Cloud, at paras. 130-35.
