New Insight from Contemporary Data on Normal Labor Curve
‘Traditionally, normal ranges forthe duration ofthe stages of labor have been based on

data from Friedman's studies in the 1950's" Research from Zhang has updated our

understanding of what is normal for contemporary women in terms of labor duration *

Likely the most significant new understanding is that, for most women, active labor doesn't
‘begin until six centimeters of cervical dilation, nat three centimeters as thought by Friedman.
‘According to Zhang etal, haif of women are not yet active at 4-5 cm dilaton. Thus they
ecommend using 6 cm as the start ofthe active phase of labor.

‘Another key take-away from this contemporary data is that for nulliparous women, labor
‘accelerates at greater dilations but there is no clear inflection point as previously thought. In
muttiparas labor generally accelerates after 6 cm dilation.

‘Additionally, Zhang and colleagues highlight that using the “average” as the parameter for
‘uiing labor management decisions is not suitable for the management of the individual patient.
Father, women should be compared to the longest normal duration tha is stil associated with
healthy birth outcomes (also known as 95" percentile values) forthe first and second stages of
labor.
