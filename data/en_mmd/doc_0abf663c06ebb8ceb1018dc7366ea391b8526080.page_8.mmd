Guide me, 0 Thou great Redeemer,
pilgrim through this barren land;
am weak, but Thou art mighty,
hold me with Thy pow’rful hand
Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven,
feed me till want no more;

feed me till want no more.

Open now the crystal fountain
whence the healing stream doth flow;
Let the fire and cloudy pillar

ead me all my journey through.
Strong Deliv‘rer, strong Deliv’rer,

be Thou still my Strength and Shield;
be Thou still my Strength and Shield.

When | tread the verge of Jordan
bid my anxious fears subside;

Death of death and hell's destruction,
land me safe on Canaan's side:

songs of praises, songs of praises,

| will ever give to Thee;

| will ever give to Thee.

Wiliam Willams (1717-1781)

The Loo bless you and keep you; the Loro make his face to
shine upon you, and be gracious to you; the Loo lift up his
