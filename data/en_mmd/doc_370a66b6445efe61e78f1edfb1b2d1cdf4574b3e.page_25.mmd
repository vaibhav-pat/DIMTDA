the law concerning mitigation.
(0) The law disallows recovery of damages in respect of any oss that could have
been avoided but which the plant has falled to avoid through unreasonable
action or inaction,

(ip The plaintif may recover loss or expense incurred in a reasonable attempt to
mitigate

(i) The plaintif may not recover loss in fact avoided, even though damages
{or that loss would have been recoverable because the efforts that went

to mitigation went beyond what was required ofthe plant under the first
principle.
