Thoughts and Reflections
Student Aezommodations/Mdifations: Lesson will be diferetiated by:
+ Content, specifically
+ One to one support :
* Quiet space ° GEES
+ extratime
+ Small roup instruction ER support with reading and fine motor
+ Modeling assembly
* reassembled simple machines that = Allow time for practice/revew/repetition
could be used ina transition as = Rewording/ephvasing af instructions
scaffolding + Product, specifically:
+ Allow students to use tablets to view No assessment of product
how to videos ~The number of simple machines

‘The number of transfers of energy

+ Environment, specifically:
Students can be offered a quieter work
space

‘The lesson will begin by showing a Rube Goldberg Machine on the screen, Students will be put into
pairs and asked to brainstorm = 1. What isthe purpose of the machine? 2. What transitions/stations
‘exist? 3. Identify any simple machines inthe device. 4. Identify how many transfers of energy exist in
the system,

[After brie class discussion, it willbe determined that the machine has been created to accomplish a
‘predetermined task, involves multiple transfers of energy, and incorporates different simple
machines.
