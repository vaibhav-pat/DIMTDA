Al losses allocated in the form of heat. Therefore, one CANNOT SAY “heat” losses.

Losses are:

~ Electrical losses occur when the current passes through the conductor. According to
Joule's law, the losses powers are proportional to the current in the second degree PR, where
the resistance of conduction

~ Magnetic losses are when magnetic flux passes through steel cores.

‘The main magnetic losses in steel are of two types: from eddy currents (Foucault cur-
rents) and from remagnetization (or from hysteresis).

‘The cores of transformers and machines are recruited from thin plates of electrical steel
to reduce losses in steel (core assembly of thin plates = «sheektovka»). The thickness of the
plates is 0.5 mm. These plates isolated with varnish or oxide skin on both sides.

~ Mechanical losses ~ these are the losers from friction in bearings and air, and venti-
lation losses.

‘These losses are from friction in bearings and from friction about the air of the rotor
that rotates. Also that is the ventilation losses,

~ Additional losses ~ that are losses which are not taken into account before,

1. TRANSFORMERS
We begin to study transformers. Transformers are not electrical machines, because the
form of energy does not change in them.
Write and know!
Electrical machine — it’s electromechanic converter that converts electrical energy

into mechanical energy and vice versa, mechanical energy into electrical

chine can be both an engine and a generator.
