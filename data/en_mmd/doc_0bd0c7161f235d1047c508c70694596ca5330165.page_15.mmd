‘and Li:Os particles by LiOs disproportionation are chemical reactions, they are not detectable

by electrochemical methods. The resulting produets ~ toroidal and “donut™-shaped particle

however, are visible in the SEM images depicted in Fig. 4.2). Previous studies pointing out
Simultaneous product formation via solution growth and surface growth pathways[20,31] are

supported by the observation of the pore-clogging “bulk” product in the GDE cross

tions
aside from the already discussed particles afterdischarge with both electrolytes (see Figs. 6.)

and 7.)

Figure 5: SEM images of GDE surfaces after (a) inital discharge, (b) fist charge to ca. 3.6 V,

() first complete recharge to 4.15 V and (d) second discharge with LITFSUTEGDME: scale

‘The GDE surface after discharge with LiTFSWTEGDME (see Fig. 5a) is completely covered
by a product layer comparable to that found by Wong et aon grapitized mul-walled carbon
nanotubes afterdischarge in LiCIO\TEGDME [52]. Furthermore, this observation isin good
agreement with eports proposing that low DN electrolyte solvents enhance the LisOs surface
‘growth pathway resulting in film rather than particle formation [30.53.58]. As previously
mentioned, however, the ORR takes place most likely via both surface growth and solution

growth pathways aso with TEGDME-based electrolyte, which was reported by Ryu eta [55]
