electromagnetic, and gravitational processes (though gravitation to probably a lesser
extent, pending verifiable theories of “quantum gravity"). (p. 10)

‘All these ideas are identical to my ideas from 2008! The authors use notions like “self-
“organizing”, “non-locality”, or “my mind” (etc.) exactly with the same meaning as I used in my
works. AL the end, the title of a section is this one: “IF qualia are all there is” with the frst
sentence: “We thus offer this Fundamental Awareness framework, in which an

axiomatic, pure, self-reflexive, non-dual awareness is the substratum of

existence.” (p. 16) Again tis is one of my essential ideas!

Tam sure in the book we can find much more very SIMILAR ideas to my ideas
(2002-2008)! The same verdict about the ideas of these authors published in their previous
works (2013-2016).

+ (2018) Did David Bourget (forthcoming 2018) (Director, Centre for
Digital Philosophy, Western University (or University of Western
Ontario) plagiarize my ideas regarding the mind-brain problem?!

In this chapter, I will investigate the article “Anomalous Panpsychism: A Novel Approach to the
Mind-Body Problem” (forthcoming 2018) by David Bourget®. There are quite many important
ideas very similar to my ideas.

Even if Bourget analyzes certain approaches in philosophy of mind (panpsychi
anomalism, physicalism, anti-physicalism, dualism, etc), he introduces a new approach to the
mind-brain problem: “a kind of anomalous dualism, nonreduetive anomalous panpsychism” (for
solving mental causation problem and mapping problem).

“The sim ofthis paper isto explore the viability of this view as an approach tothe mind-body problem, More
spoifialy am strested ia Finding ou wheter this view is promising
fora duals view.(p. 4)

Suddenly, more and more people are interested in “dualism”. Until I wrote my article (Synthese
2005) and my book (2008) nobody returned to Descartes’ dualism during centuries. Everybody
‘considered a wrong approach during this period.

In section 2, Bourget refers to “mental causation”. Within the EDWs perspective, solved
‘the mental causation problem in my book 2008! He presents certain notions related to mental
causation that appear in Davidson (1970) (see Vacariu 2008): completeness, physical
determinism, mental efficiency, no-over-determination, contrafactual dependence. (pp. 5-6)

“In the same volume (or pilpapers), the reader can Find Chalmers’ paper on the same topic
‘Amazing, David Bourget is (or was) “director (something similar) to the site of artilestbooks
