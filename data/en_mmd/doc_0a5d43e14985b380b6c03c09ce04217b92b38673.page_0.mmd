Rule 138

Roman Halder (I)

Subject: Climate fraud

Nowadays, itis rare that a company does not have a sustainably strategy. Companies find it
important to become completely carbon-nuiral. They achieve tis by offsetting their CO; emissions
through the purchase of certfeates. The idea is thal every tonne of CO» emitted by a company is
{ved elzavinere. The non prot organisation Vera is being accused ofeeling worthless CO
Cerificales. A thorough investigation by the weekly newspaper’ Die Ze and other investigative
plattorns has now confirmed these accusations. Ther analysis shows that a substantial proportion of
Cereals issued by Verra ate wortless asthe relevant requirements, relating for example to forest
Conservation, are not being tulled.

1. Whatis the Commission's view on companies presenting themselves as carbon- neutral even
though the certteates are not tusbworthy?

2. The more deforestation anticipated by project operators in ther forests, the more ceriicates they
‘can issue the more money they can earn and the more ceticates Verra can sel, the more
revenue itcan colet and the more other companies can offset ther carbon emissions. What
faclon does the Commission intend 0 take to combat this climate fraud?
