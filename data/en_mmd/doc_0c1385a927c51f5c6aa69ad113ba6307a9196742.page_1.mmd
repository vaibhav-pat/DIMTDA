Believe it or not, a study has shown that teens in the 1950s had a better diet than
they do now — even though they were poorer and the food they had was more limited.
Although children ate more animal fat in the 1950s (like butter and meat), they also did
more exercise.

Now

After the invention of fridges, freezers and microwave oven, convenience food
became more common. This meant people could buy pre-cooked food and meals and
frozen food ~ rather than cooking at home. But this also means less fresh food is
prepared now.

‘The British diet has become more varied. Chinese and Indian food is more popular, as
well as hamburger and pizza restaurants. The UK now has a multicultural population
~ and because of this, there are more foods to choose from, such as Vielnamese,
Japanese Italian and Greek.

Crisps, chips, sweets, fizzy drinks and fast food. These things weren't at all common
in the 1950s ~ but they are everyday foods now. Today only 1 in § children had five or
more portions of fruit or vegetables a day ~ and Brits eat over 150,000 McDonald's
burgers a day!

People are more likely to eat a snack while moving between two places, or eat
‘something while standing up or on public transport, such as the bus or train. Eating is
less of a special occasion and often something to fit around a busy schedule.

(One study has found that 42 % of teens eat their dinners while watching TV! The study
‘showed that kids who eat dinner with their families at a table eat more vegetables and
drink more water and fewer fizzy drinks than those who don't. Ealing while watching
TVs more likely to lead to snacking and weight problems.
