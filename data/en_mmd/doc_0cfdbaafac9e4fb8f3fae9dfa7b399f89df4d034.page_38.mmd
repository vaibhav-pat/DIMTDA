HELPING CHILDREN COPE- SOME GENERAL TIPS

> Try to tell the children together and take time to plan what you're going
to say.

> Choose a time when you can be with the children after breaking the
news.

> Outline the main arrangements for their schooling, where and with whom
they will ive, where the other parent will ive, and arrangements for
ongoing contact with both parents and the extended family.

> Give a clear message that the separation Is in no way the fault of the
children and that there was nothing they could or should have done to
stop it.

> Emphasise that although you, the parents, are separating, you will still be
their parents. The conflict is between the parents, not between the
parents and the children.

» Tell the children that both parents love them and that they will always be
part of their lives.

» Check if the children have questions and be prepared to answer the same
questions again and again over the next days, weeks and months.

> Children need to manage the process of telling others, for example,
friends at school. Parents should help them through how they want to do
this, and they should give a clear message that is not a secret or
something of which the children should be ashamed.

> Give children time and space to express their thoughts and feelings

> Minimise the life changes your child has to endure.

» Maintain the quality of your parenting - they need your encouragement,
love and attention as well as your rules, guidance and boundaries, as
much if not more than before.

> Being a good parent means accepting the other parent's role in your
child's life and taking steps to support their involvement.
