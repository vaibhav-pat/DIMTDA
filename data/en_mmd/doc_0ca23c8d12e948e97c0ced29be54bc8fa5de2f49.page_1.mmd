Cocktail Parties
Create a plan

It you plan to serve appetizers before a meal, consider what you will be serving for the
dinner portion of the meal and try to select complementary appetizers. Timeline (how
long is the event) and timeframe (what time of day is the event) are also contributing
factors. If you are hosting an “hors d oeuvre only" event during a common a meal time
(6-8pm for example) guests will eat more compared to a come-and-go open house style
‘event held mid-afternoon,

‘These are guidelines for hors d'oeuvres set out on a buffet. Every party and
every menu have different details which affect the final proposal

Appetizers w/ a Dinner ~ 6 appetizers per person. Serve only 2 to 3 appetizers (2-3
pieces of each per person). You want to "wake up” your guests’ palette but not ruin
their appetite.

Cocktail Party ~ 8 to 12 appetizers pieces per person. Guests will generally eat about
55 appetizers each during the first hour and will eat about 3 appetizers each for each
‘subsequent hour. Adding dips or displays could reduce the appetizer count,

“For Butler/Tray Passed hors d'oeuvres the count may be lower, however, additional
staff may be required.

Other Things to Consider

‘Acommon misconception is “lighter on the food equals lighter on the wallet”. In most
cases, cocktail parties are not a less expensive alternative to a full dinner. Keep in
mind, the detail and labor involved in hand preparing each item is time consuming
Additionally, some items require “building” on site and therefore are not available for
drop-off service. Those items are marked with an * on our menu.
