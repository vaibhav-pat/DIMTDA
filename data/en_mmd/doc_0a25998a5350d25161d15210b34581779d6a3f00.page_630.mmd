At that level, biologists talk about and think about what genes stand

for, rather than focusing on their traditional physico-chemical properties.
And

they implicitly accept the fact that this new, “leaner and meaner” way of
talking suggests that genes, thanks to their informational qualities, have
their own causal properties — or in other words, that certain extremely
abstract large-scale events or states of affairs (for example, the high-level
regularity that golden retrievers tend to be very gentle and friendly) can

validly be attributed to meanings of molecules.

233 Although I’ve put each of the above items in quotation marks, I am not
talking about the written words, nor am I talking about the observable
phenomena in the world that these expressions “point to”. I am talking about

the concepts in my mind and your mind that these terms designate — or, to

revert to an earlier term, about the corresponding sym@o/s in our respective
brains

237 The strange loop

making up an “I” is no more a pinpointable, extractable physical object than
an audio feedback loop is a tangible object possessing a mass and a diameter.
Such a loop may exist “inside” an auditorium, but the fact that it is
physically localized doesn’t mean that one can pick it up and heft it, let
alone measure such things as its temperature and thickness! An “I” loop, like
an audio feedback loop, is an abstraction — but an abstraction that seems
immensely real, almost physically palpable, to beings like us, beings that
have high readings on the hunekometer.
