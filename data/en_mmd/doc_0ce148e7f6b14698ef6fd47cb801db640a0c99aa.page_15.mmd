Now consider the transformer idle experience. Let's draw the experimental scheme
and the scheme of substitution, fig. 1.5

In this experiment (when idling) we can determine the following parameters,
Fig. 15:

1) Losses of steel power (magnetic losses) Po= Pru

Itis constant losses: they do not depend on the load.

2) Power factor in the experience of idling

‘m_— number phases: Upw~ nominal voltage of prime winding;
Jyo~ the current of the idling experience (magnetization current)
3) Magnetizing current /,0 ~ the current of the idling experience;

In the experience of idling, we can determine only these parameters. But we have to
determine separately every one.

5) E~To determine the reduced value of the secondary winding EMF, itis necessary
to construct a vector diagram. The value E/ can be obtained only graphically.

We construct a vector diagram from the equations:
