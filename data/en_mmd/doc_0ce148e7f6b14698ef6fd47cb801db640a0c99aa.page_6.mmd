‘The operating principle of transformer

‘The alternating current is supplied to the primary winding,

Current creates an alternating magnetic field. The magnetic flux closes along the core
and in the secondary winding induces electromotive force (EMF). It’s mutual induction,

‘The magnetic flux closes on itself. Therefore, in the primary winding, the flux also
induces an EMF, which is called the EMF of self-induction (induction by itself).
