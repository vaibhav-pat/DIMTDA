A key requirement for our analysis was that the levels of conformity to FA of desites and of

beliefs would be significantly different from one another. Study 1 found this to be the ease
such that levels of conformity to FA of desires and of beliefs can be used as benchmarks for
evaluating degrees of certitude of moral judgements." In addition, we found no evidence that

degrees of desire in level of conformity to FA, and ~ more importantly to determine whether
degres of centitude of moral judgements were more similar tothe former or the later.
