condition, participants were randomly assigned to report their degrees of beliet/desire/moral

judgment with respeet to statement A or to statement B, but not to both

Measurements

The independent variable was attitude (three levels: belie, desire, and moral judgment). The
dependent variables were the levels of conformity to FA of the components (A, B), which were
evaluated independently. For dilemma iin attude j, we calculated the level of conformity to

FA, as before,

Results

Are degree of moral judgment and degree of desire correlated?

The relationships between degrees of moral judgment, degrees of desire, and degrees of belief

were tested using correlations between the average responses of desires

1d of moral judgments

for each statement (A or B) for each dilemma, There was a significant correlation between

degrees of desire and degrees of moral judgment [r(40) = 0.86, p < 0.001]. No significa

correlations were foy

1d between degrees of belief and degrees of moral judgment [r(40) =

0.25, p= 0.10), nor between degrees of belief and degrees of desire [7(40) = 021, p

0.17]. In addition, we ran a Bayesian correlation which indicated substantial evidence [BFiy >

1000] forthe hypothesis that there was a correlation between degrees of desire and degrees of

‘moral judgments. Ths finding that one can stop collecting data since the evidence is

conclusive (Rouder, 2014),
