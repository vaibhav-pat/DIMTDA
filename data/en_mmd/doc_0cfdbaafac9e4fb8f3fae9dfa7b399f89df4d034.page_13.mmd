WHAT IS A JUDICIAL SEPARATION?

Following marital breakdown and a period of separation, a spouse may apply for
a Judicial Separation. The effect of obtaining a Judicial Separation is that both
spouses are relieved ofthe obligation to cohabit. The spouse seeking the
separation is called the Applicant and the spouse defending the separation is
called the Respondent. Both the High Court and the Circuit Court have
jurisdiction to hear Judicial Separations, depending on the extent of the family
property.

WHAT ARE THE GROUNDS FOR A JUDICIAL
SEPARATION?
> Adultery.
> Asspouse has behaved in such a manner that the other spouse can no
longer be expected to reside with him/her. This relates mainly to grounds
of cruelty both mental and physical.
» The spouse has deserted or forced the other to leave the home at least
one year before the date of the application.
» The spouses have lived apart for one year immediately before the date of
the application.
> The marriage between both spouses has broken down irretrievably and
the Court is satisfied that a normal marital relationship has not existed
between the spouses for the period of at least one year immediately
before the date of the application.

Irretrievable breakdown is the most common ground and can be used by
a spouse who may be at “fault” for the break up of the marriage.
