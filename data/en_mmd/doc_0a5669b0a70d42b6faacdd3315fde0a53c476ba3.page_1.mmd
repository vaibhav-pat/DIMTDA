Practice symmetrical patterns with math manipulatives.

Lesson Steps Outline

Day One
1. Define symmetry, guide practice making symmetrical patterns with math
manipulatives.

@ Criteria-based teacher checklist: Uses math manipulatives to create mirror and
radial symmetry.

2. View and discuss art examples with a keen eye for symmetry.

@ Criteria-based teacher checklist: Recognizes shapes in mirror or radial
symmetry in various works of art.

3. Guide students in designing a shape to use as their template for the final clay
mosaic. Students and teachers check shapes to confirm their size and simple
shape.

@ Criteria-based self-assessment and teacher checklist: Creates and uses a
template to transfer shape design to clay with precision.

Day Two
4, Guide students in preparing plan for mosaic. After the students have cut out
their shapes, guide practice arranging their shapes using multiple lines of
symmetry. Provide a template of size and shape of backing, Students try
multiple arrangements while sharing their line of symmetry with table partners.
