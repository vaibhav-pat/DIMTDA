“Jambalaya is a symbiosis, a synthesis, a fusion. The same goes
for STEM

Now, Ibe the first to admit how silly a comparison between
food and an academic field sounds. But | have become more
‘and more concerned with the STEM label, and how itis
Conditioning us to keep old habits. STEM is an unfortunate
acronym, because we look forthe S, the T, the E, and the M
when we develop curriculum. That is, we look for where the
science is, where the technology part goes, how engineering is,
present, and how can we add the math part. STEM is not
S.E.M, whore the letters are separated. STEM is a new word,
‘a merger. We should have called STEM something completely
different, ust to force us away from this thinking of separate
fields. STEM is a combination. tis all pats savored together,
just ike jambalaya”
