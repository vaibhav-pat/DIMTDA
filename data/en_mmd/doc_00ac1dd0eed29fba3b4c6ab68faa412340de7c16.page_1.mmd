Jab Step: This is used by most catchers in baseball. The catcher
jab steps with his right foot to an area on the ground just below
his chin at the center of his body. Itis crucial to keep the
catcher's footwork confined to an imaginary circle around him.
This enables short, compact footwork, which initiates quickness.
Regardless of which footwork is used, the catcher must make his
back foot become parallel to the front edge of the plate and keep
his front toe pointed directly towards second base.

On throws to third base, the catcher must always work to clear
himselt if a right-handed hitter is at the plate.

If positioned deep in the box correctly, the catcher should have
somewhat of a straight line to third base. In extreme cases, a
catcher may opt to go in front of the hitter on pitches low and
away. Either way, the footwork should be confined and compact,

TRANSFER

The exchange is a critical part of the throwing process. Many
errant throws are a result of bobbled transfers or bad grips.

The catcher should make a two-handed catch when receiving the
ball.

The transfer is made by picking the ball out of the glove, not
flipping the ball to the bare hand.

The transfer is made at the center of the body. Do not carry the
glove side back to the throwing shoulder.

The catcher should work on getting a strong first grip on the ball
Four seams is a plus.

UPPER/LOWER BODY

The catcher needs to stay as low and compact as possible while
throwing.
Legs should stay flexed throughout the throw.
