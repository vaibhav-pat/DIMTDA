1. Scattering that results from the loss of some
‘energy ofthe incoming photon when i ejects an
‘outer shell elctron roma tiseue atom

“The electron ejacted from an atom during a
photoelectric interaction

3. An expression ofthe ratio of the numberof ight,

‘Photons at the output phosphor tothe numberof

light photons emitted inthe input

Phosphor represents the tube's conversion

8. During fluoroscopy, the process of creating a
brighter vile mage

11. The attenuated x-ay beam leaving the pationt

'5. The diference between the x-ay photons that
fare absorbed photoelacrcaly versus those that
enetrate the body
‘The altenvated x-ray beam eaves the pationt
