Making Materials
‘As we are looking at materials
thought it would be nice to
find out how lots of fabrics ace
made by weaving yarn. You
can wrap a long piece of woo!
around a book, leaving spaces
in between s0 that you can
‘weave in and out. We call this
the warp. You can weave the
other threads (the weft) in and
out. Go under and over each
thread,

There is some yarn in the
learning pack oF you can use
‘your awn, | have even torn up
‘ld ¢ shirts before to make 2
‘thread that canbe woven,

I this is abit tricky you could
‘ry weaving with paper
instead. Remember i's over
and under and make sure if
‘you went over the thread last
‘time, go under the next time.
