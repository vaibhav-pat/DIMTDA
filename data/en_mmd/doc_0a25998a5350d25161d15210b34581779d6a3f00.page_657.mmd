‘This new ontological picture requires that we expandour pt
of ‘what is

real’ 10 includean extraspatiotemporal domainof quantum possibilty,
Thus, we — need

to “think outsidethe spacetime box.’. Other researchers have recently
suggested that

spacetime isnot fundamental. For example, Ney hasbeen
‘advocating what she terms

“Wave Fu Realist,” Which the wave function is taken

as ontologically real

‘and spacetime phenomena comprise only a subspace ofthat
‘ontology: “What appears

inthe derivative thee-dimensional metaphysics a8 nonlocal
influence is explained by

the ‘evolution of the wave function
in its space where there are
no nonlocal influences.” (Ney 2017). Our approach differs

that we regard measurement as a

real, non-unitary process, and donot take the universe as
a whole to be — described by

4 position-basis wavefunction; but the spirit of allowing fora
larger ontology for the

quantum realm is essentially the same.” (13-4)

[in our book 2016, we indicated spacetime cannot ahve any ontological status!!!!1H11H1H]

We have argued that an appropriate realist understanding of quantum

mechani calls for the metaphysical
tegory of res potentia, just
as Heisenberg suggested long ago. In paticular, we suggest

4 mon-substance dualism of res potentia,

and res extensa——as-——smutually——implicative modes of existence,
Where quantum states

instantiate a particular, quantifiable form of res potentia,

“Quantum — Potentiae” (QP).
