Abstract

Effective screening of SARS-CoV-2 or other infections enables quick and efficient diagnosis
‘and can mitigate the burden on healtheate systems, Prediction models that combine several
Features to estimate the risk of infection have been developed. These aim to assist medical staff
Worldwide in tiaging patients, especially in the context of limited healtheare resources. We
established a machine-learning approach that trained on multiple records, confirmed infections
‘and controls. Our model predicted infections with high aecuracy using only a handful of binary
features. Our framework can be used, among other considerations, to prioritize testing for
COVID-19 and other types of infections when testing resources are limited
