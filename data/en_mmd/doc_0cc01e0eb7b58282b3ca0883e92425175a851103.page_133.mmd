TENNESSEE
Bless her dainty heart.

EDWINA
(looking through Machine) Huh... I’m not seeing her
again. I think you got rid of her!

TENNESSEE
Okay. Sorry, folks. Small detours; not gonna happen
again. Who’s next on the schedule?

TENN puts the sides back in the drawer.
DIANA pulls the pill bottle out of her purse,
opens it, and peeks at its contents. Looking
to TENN, she exhales and lets all the pills
tumble down her throat.

TENNESSEE
(re: EDWINA’s reaction) What? What are you—?

TENN sees what DIANA’s doing and gasps.

TENNESSEE
What?! No... no, no, no...

DIANA exits, stumbling.
