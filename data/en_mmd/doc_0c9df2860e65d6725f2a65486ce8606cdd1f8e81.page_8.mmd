Older Driver ~ Practical Driving Course

There has been much reference made to the increased risks to Older Drivers,
especially those aged 70+, where RTC data highlights an increase within this age
{group in collision rates alongside the primary driver being at fault within the RTC.

RTC data also shows that collisions involving drivers aged 70+ are more likely to be
serious or fatal (KSI) than for the 40-60 year old control group.

Essex Police Roads Policing Command has, since the development of CRASH,
been keen to maximise the benefits and advances in technology for RTC collision
recording and has actively used CRASH to identify “risk” associated to this age
{group especially through proactive targeting of individuals requiring eye sight tests
and DVLA medical referrals.

During 2019, SERP will introduce a free 90 minute practical course to drivers aged
70+ utlising existing instructors currently delivering the National Driving Advisory
Course (NDAC), with the course focusing upon the following identified areas:

Night driving
Complex junctions, signals and roundabouts

Road sign recognition

Medication impacting upon driving (inking in with health care professionals)
Eye sight tests

‘Any bespoke requests made by the individual
