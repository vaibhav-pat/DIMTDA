Introduction

Most animals must interact with spatially complex and dynamic environments in order to

survive. For example, an animal may navigate through a forest, carefully avoiding some

‘objects, while carefully intercepting others. n appropriate sensory

s ability requires

apparatus, and the cognitive capacity to interpret the afferent signals into relevant information

about the spatial arrangement of it

‘own body within the wider environment. Theoretical

(Gibson, 1966; O'Regan & Nod, 2001) and experimental studies (Dupin & Wexler, 2013)
have largely focussed on visually-guided self-motion. However, the same logie applies also

somatosensory systems. Sensory endings on the skin, and internal to the musculoskeletal

system, can specify whether an object is touching the body, along with how and where itis
touching. Indeed, bumping our bodies against extemal objects provides a primitive

experiential evidence for realism about the external world, Johnson's “I refute it thus”

Bishop Berkeley comes to mind,

‘der the computations and representations involved in spatial perception

fon the skin, Classi

ly, cognitive psychology has emphasised that somatosensory spatial

information must be transformed into external spatial coordinates for the purposes of

functional interaction. For example, Longo and colleagues proposed an additive model in

Which a

timulus is first localised on the receptor sheet of the skin, then the skin is localised

‘on the body,

finally the body is localised in space (Longo, Mancini, & Haggard, 2015).

Proprioceptive informa

bout limb positions in space, encoded in a representation
sometimes called the “body schema” (Paillard, 1999), plays a crucial role in this second

r

nsformation. Taken together, this set of computations would allow, for example, a reaching
movement towatds the somatosensory stimulus, as when we swat a mosquito that has

‘lighted on the thigh or the cheek. Studies of tactile remapping suggest that the
