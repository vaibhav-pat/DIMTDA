Fig. 4.22 — Design of damper windings of synchronous machine rotors

‘The following conditions must be fulfilled:
1) The EMF of the generator stator winding must be equal to the mains voltage
Ea= Van

2) The frequency of the generator voltage must be equal to the frequency of the mains
voltage f, = fern

3) The order of alternation of the generator phases should be the same as the order of
the electrical network phases (ABO)ex = (ABC)ax

4) When the generator is turned on, its voltage should be in the same phase as the mains
voltage.

‘Synchronoscopes are used simultaneously to determine the fulfillment of all conditions
‘Now arrow synchroscopes are using. All conditions are met when the arrow enters the cen-

tral sector.
Earlier synchroscope was made of lamps (fig. 4.23). Now use the arrow synchroscope
(fig. 4.24). All conditions are met when the arrow enters the sector.

is tumed on when the lamps go out; b) according to the “rotation of the fire".
‘The generator circuit breaker is turned on when the lamps switch (on and off) rhythmically
