‘Speed enforcement ~ Development of Trucam Project

Through community consultation, excess vehicle speeds remain a concern and
priority for many local communities across the force area. Whilst we continue to
operate within a challenging environment, we have needed to look at additional
‘opportunities with partners to maximise the use of speed detection technology and
available powers.

In December 2017, Maldon District Council Community Protection Otticers launched
atrial scheme developed by Essex Police which allowed their staff to enforce speed
limits across the Maldon District. The scheme has progressed well with 171
deployments at 54 enforcement sites across the district. This compliments the
existing speed enforcement operations by Essex Police and monitoring activity
undertaken by local Community Speed Watch groups.
