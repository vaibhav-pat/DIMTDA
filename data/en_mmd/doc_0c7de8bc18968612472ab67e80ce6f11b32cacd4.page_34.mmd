this the “desire as expected moral value thesis.”

‘This “desire as expected moral value thesis” is based on the assumption that there exists
‘numerical scale for measuring degrees of moral value. The important point, inthe context of
our discussion, is thatthe DBT (as originally formulated by Lewis) is consistent with the “desire

as expected moral value thesis”

ly when the scale used for measuring degrees of moral value

Inother words, the DBT isa private case ofthe “desire as expected moral value thesis,”
the private case in which moral value is measured on a tsvial binary O/1 scale. Since itis at

is approximately true, and that a trivial binary Q/1 seale cannot adequately represent the way

cleuely support the DBT ~ ate surprising.

Conclusion

Our studies show that, in terms of one

itive measure, degrees of certtudes of moral
judgements tend to have an approximately probabilistic structure. We additionally showed that

these degrees ate related to degrees of desires in the way predicted by the DBT.
