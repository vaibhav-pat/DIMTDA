76 What I just told is the story at a gross (thermodynamic) level. Nobody
who designs combustion engines worries about the fine-grained level —
that of molecules. No engineer tries to figure out the exact trajectories of
1023 molecules banging into each other! The locations and velocities of
individual molecules are simply irrelevant. All that matters is that they can
be counted on to co/lectively push the piston out. Indeed, it doesn’t matter
whether they are molecules of type X or type Y or type Z — pressure is
pressure, and that’s all that matters. The explosion — a high-level event —
will do its job in heating the gas, and the gas will do its job in pushing the

piston. This high-level description of what happens is the on/y level of
description that is relevant, because all the microdetails could be changed
and exactly the same thing (at least from the human engineer's point of
view) would still happen.

76 The Strange Irvelevance of Lower Levels
{this subtitle minrors exactly the EDWs!!!

Those air molecules could have done exactly the

same kid-music job in an astronomical number of different but humanly
indistinguishable fashions. The lower-level laws of their collisions played a
role only in that they gave rise to predictable high-level events (propagation
of the notes in the Chopin étude to little Douggie’s ear). But the positions,
speeds, directions, even the chemical identity of the molecules — all of this
was changeable, and the high-level events would have been the same. It
would have been the same music to my ears. One can even imagine that the
microscopic laws of physics could have been different — what matters i
not the detailed laws but merely the fact that they reliably give rise to stable
statistical consequences
