“Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the
princes of Judah, who retreated to Jerusalem because of
Shishak, and said unto them, “Thus the LORD says, You have
forsaken me; therefore I have also forsaken you in the hand
of Shishak.’”

“Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves
saying, “The LORD is righteous.”

“When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the
word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, ‘They have
humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I
will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be
poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know
My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the
countries.”

“So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and
took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the
treasures of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away
also the shields of gold which Solomon had made. In place
of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that
kept the entrance of the king’s house. When the king entered
the house of the LORD, the guard came, carried them, and
returned them to the guard chamber.

“When he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned
away from him; so that He would not destroy him
completely: and things in Judah also went better (after that].”

‘What we see in this report i

+ Shishak came with massive force: one does not employ massive
force against an insignificant adversary.

+ Shishak crushed the fenced cities first, thus removing Rehoboam’s
ability to defend himself.
