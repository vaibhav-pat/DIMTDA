While the philosophy of

jimal rights notably implies that moral agents have a duty not teat

animals (humans and nonhumans) unjustly, it also acknowledges a duty to assist vietims of

injustice, which demands that moral agents do everything in their power to minimize, and ideally

eliminate, the injustices others face (Regan 1983, 249). Since moral actors need compassion in

‘order to be sufficiently motivated to act in accordance with the judgment that “animals ought to

With values that they otherwise likely wouldn't have” (Bekoff 2016). He explains that rewilding
