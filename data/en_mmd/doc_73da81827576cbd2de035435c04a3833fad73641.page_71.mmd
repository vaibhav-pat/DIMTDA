«Includes information deemed necessaty to achieve effective property accountability, for
‘example, hardware inventory specifications (manufacturer, type, model, serial number,
physical location, software license information, information system / component owner,
associated component configuration standard, software/fiemware version informati
‘and for a networked componentidevice, the machine name and network addeess,

Includes system and network diagram

1s. Is available for review and audit by designated organizational officials,

fh. Is included in property accountability information, a means for identifying by name a
tole individuals responsible for administering those components. A system containing
restricted or highly restricted data may have multiple Data Owners, and/or System
‘Administrators, but must have a single System Owner,

i. Includes assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to cur
deployed configurations in the information system component inventory,

i. Review and update the information system component inventory through periodic manual
inventory checks or a network monitoring ool that automatically maintains the inventory,

Includes all components that store, process, or transmit restricted or highly restricted

Contsol Implementation Description

CM-8(3) Control Notes:
NC DIT has identified this control as MANDATORY for Moderate se
systems.

NC DIT has identified this control as OPTIONAL for Low sensitivity information systems,

vity information

For a Moderate system update the control entry to document the control implementation as with
any other contro.

choosing to implement this optional control for a Low sensitivity system, update the control
entry to document the control implementation as with any other conte

If choosing not to implement this optional control for a Low sensitivity system, ether delete the
entire control entry of update the control entzy to document the decision.

Delete this note box after deleting or updating the control entry.
