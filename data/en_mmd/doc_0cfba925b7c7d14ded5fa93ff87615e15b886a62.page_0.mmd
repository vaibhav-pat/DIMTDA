Name of Policy, Strategy or Service

“The Registers of Scotland (Information and Access, etc.) Miscellaneous Amendment
Order 2022

‘STEP ONE ~ DEVELOP A CLEAR UNDER:

STANDING OF YOUR OBJECTIVES.

‘© What are the objectives of the
policy, strategy or service?

‘© What are the intended impacts /
‘outcomes and how do these
potentially differ in the islands?

‘This Order complements the Registers of Scotland (Digital Registration, etc.)
Regulations 2022, which will open up the Books of Council and Session (BCS) to
electronic documents from 1* October 2022. It sets out the basis on which the
Keeper must issue BCS extracts, and the default form these extracts should take.
Where an electronic document is registered, the default form of extract issued will be
an electronic document. Where a paper document is registered, the default form of
extract will be a paper document. In both cases, paperielectronic extracts will also be
available on request.

In addition, this Order also clarifies that extracts of deeds registered in the Register of
Sasines can be issued as electronic documents where the applicant requests. This
brings the Register of Sasines into line with the Land Register provision at section
104(7) of the Land Registration etc. (Scotland) Act 2012.

Finally, this Order makes a number of clarificatory amendments to the Writs
Execution (Scotland) Act 1877 to reflect that BCS and Register of Sasine extracts,
issued by Registers of Scotland, and BCS extracts issued by National Records of
Scotland, can be issued in electronic form, and to remove reference to legislation
which is no longer in force.
