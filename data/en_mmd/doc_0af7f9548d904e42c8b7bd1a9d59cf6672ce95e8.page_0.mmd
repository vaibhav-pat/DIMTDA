Straight line graphs

ALEVEL LINKS
Scheme of work: 2, Straight-line graphs, parallel/perpendicular length and area problems

Key points

‘© Astright line has the equation y= mac, where m is
the gradient and eis the y-inercept (where x= 0)

1+ The equation ofa straight line ean be written in the frm
ax by +60, where a, band care integers.

‘+ When given the coordinates (2,91) and (1,92) of 90
points om a line the gradients calculated using the

formula m

Examples

Example 1A straight ine has gradient

© and y-intercep 3.
Write the equation ofthe line inthe form ax + by +6=0.

1A straight line has equation
‘y= mre, Substitute the gradient
and j-interepe given inthe question
into this equation,

2. Rearrange the equation so all the
terms ae on one side and 0 is on
the othe side

3) Multiply both sides by 2to
<liminate the denominator.

‘Example 2 Find the gradient and the y-intercet of the line with the equation 3y ~2x +

3y-2r44=0 1 Make y the subject ofthe equation
Byer 4
2. Divide all dhe terms by thre to get
the equation inthe form

3 Inthe form y = m+ the graient
is mand the intercept isc

Gradient = m
