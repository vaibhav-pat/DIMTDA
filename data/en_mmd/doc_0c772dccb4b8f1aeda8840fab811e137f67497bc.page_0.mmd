Preamble
‘These bylaws apply to Arizona State University’s School of Sustainability (SOS), which was
founded in 2006 by the Arizona Board of Regents. The bylaws describe the procedures by which
‘SOS self-governs and caries out the responsibilities and privileges entrusted to SOS. The bylaws
are junior to policies and procedures laid out in ASU’s Academie Affairs Manual (ACD). In ease
‘of conflicts, the policies and procedures of ASU and the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) take
precedence.

SOS leadership and its faculty embrace ASU's mission as being a comprehensive public research
university, measured not by whom it excludes, but rather by whom it includes and how they
succeed; advancing research and discovery of public value; and assuming fundamental
‘esponsibility forthe economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves.
