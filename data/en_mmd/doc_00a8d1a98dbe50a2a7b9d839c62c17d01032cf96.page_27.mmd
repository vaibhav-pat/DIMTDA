of the courts or seriously interfered with the administration of justice. This high
threshold is met where a court has before it an unfounded, frivolous, dilatory or
vexatious proceeding that denotes serious abuse of the judicial system by the
lawyer, or dishonest or malicious misconduct on his or her part, that is deliberate:

iv. APPEAL OF Costs AWARD

Section 676.1 of the Criminal Cade provides that any party who is ordered to pay
costs may appeal the order or the quantum with leave.

Leave to appeal is also required pursuant to 8. 183(b) of the Courts of Justice
‘Act and R. 61.03.1(17) of the ules of Civil Procedure. However, leave to appeal
is not required for an award of costs that relies on inherent jurisdiction as opposed
to statutory jurisdiction: Hunt v. Worrad, 2019 ONCA 540

THE CROWN

‘A. ROLE OF

‘The Crown is entitled to argue its case forcefully but, “The role of the prosecutor
‘excludes any notion of winning or losing: his function is a matter of public duty.

It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the
seriousness and the justness of judicial proceedings” A v John, 2016 ONCA
615 at para 77, quoting Boucher

Canadian courts have repeatedly stressed that Crown prosecutors are not simply
advocates; they are ministers of justice. Crown prosecutors are expected to press
their position firmly and advance their position effectively, even with a degree of
rhetorical passion:. Crown prosecutors must, however, temper their advocacy.
‘They are not to appeal to emotion by engaging in ‘inflammatory rhetoric,
demeaning commentary or sarcasm’. Nor are they to corrupt the fair reach of
‘evidence in their submissions by suggesting that there are inconsistencies when
there are not: A v Roberts, 2018 ONCA 411 at para 120
