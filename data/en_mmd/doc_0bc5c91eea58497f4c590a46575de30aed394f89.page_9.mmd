6.0 Definitions/Reference Definitions/ Technical Standards Definitions
6.1 Bias

Systematic difference in treatment of certain objects, people, or groups in comparison to
‘others. (ISO/IEC DIS 22989)

Note : Bias is used in both data science and in legal discussions. When used in datas
bias isthe tendency of a statistic to overestimate or underestimate a parameter. From a legal
point of view. however, bias is any prejudiced or partial personal or social perception of
person or group. For the purposes of this document, bias is a data science term, and not a
legal one. Bias can be introduced into study design, conduct or analysis. Sources of bias
include selection bias (of study sample), operational bias, and analyses that do not accou
for missing data

62 Continuous Learning

‘Training that leads to change of an MLMD with each exposure to data that takes place on
aan ongoing basis during the operation phase of the MLMD life cycle. (Modified from
ISO/IEC DIS 22989)

Note : Butch Learning is a training that leads to the change of an MLMD that involves
discrete updates based on defined sets of data that take place at distinct points prior to or
‘during the operation phase of the MLMD life cycle.

6.3. Reference Standard

‘An objectively determined benchmark that is used as the expected result for comparison,
assessment, training, ete. (eg. ground truth, gold standard),

64 Reinforcement Learning

Machine learning utilizing a reward function to optimize either a policy function ora value
Jinetion by sequential interaction with an environment, (ISOMIEC DIS 22989)

Note I to entry: Policy functions and value functions express a strategy that is learned by
the environment

Note 2 to entry: The environment can be any’stateful model.
65 Reliability

Property of consistent intended behavior and results. (SOMEC DIS 22989)
