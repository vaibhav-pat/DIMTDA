Sustainable laboratories guide

The aim of this guide is to implement simple sustainable practices in
laboratories to reduce energy and resource consumption.

Save energy

* Close your fume cupboard sash when not in use.

+ Tum off and close safety cabinets when not in use.

‘+ Power down equipment whenever possible, particularly on weekends and
at night. Label equipment with turn me off stickers and use timers.

+ Turn lights and computers off at the end of the day or put your computer
in standby/hibernate mode.

* Purchase energy efficient equipment

‘© Manage Freezers according to ITD’s freezer policy and procedure. Store
only what is necessary, defrost regularly and set at -70°C

Reduce waste

+ Ensure non-hazardous waste produced in laboratories is recycled e.g
packaging from consumables and cardboard boxes.

‘Manage chemicals, order and use appropriate quantities, check if the
chemical is already available. Store and dispose of chemicals
appropriately.

‘+ Plan your experiments to avoid repeats and avoid unnecessary usage of
plastics.

* Recycle unwanted consumables, participate in and donate to the lab
consumables swap shop.
