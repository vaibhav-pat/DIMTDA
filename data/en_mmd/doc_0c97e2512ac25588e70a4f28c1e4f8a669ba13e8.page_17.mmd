Chemical Amelioration

Reclamation of alkali J sodic soils requires neutralization of
alkalinity and replacement of most of the sodium ions from the soil ~
exchange complex by the more favourable calcium ions. This can be
accomplished by the application of chemical amendments (the materials

that directly or indirectly furnish or mobilize divalent cations, usually
