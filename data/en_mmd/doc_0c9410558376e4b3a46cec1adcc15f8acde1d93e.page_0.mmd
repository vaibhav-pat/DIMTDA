The Commonwealth Games, or Friendly Games, as they are fondly known, is
‘always an exciting and memorable time for members of the Commonwealth
family. They will experience all things games-related inthe space of a few short
weeks ~ from living in the vilage, to making their debut on the field, cour, track

or pool.

These Games are unlike any other major sporting event, in that they bring
together the Commonwealth family whose dlverse faiths, races, languages,
cultures and traditions make up 30 per cent ofthe word's population. Our love
‘of sport and friendly competition nites us, but the Commonwealth Games
leaves a lasting legacy long after the last medal has been awarded. In many
instances, itis what we take away from this event that has the potential to be a

significant catalyst for change and growth in all societies.

This year’s Commonwealth Games, fr the first time since they began in 1930,
will award an equal number of medals to both women and men, highlighting the
‘Commonwealth's commitment to equality and inclusion, and serving as an
international platform to drive change and promote gender equality. We are
currently in a golden era for women's sport, and these women are ambassadors

role models who inspire change across the community.

‘As a comerstone of the Commonwealth itself, our dynamic sporting movement
~ driven by its values of Humanity, Equality and Destiny ~ has a key role to play
in an energised, engaged and active Commonwealth of Nations and Territories.
