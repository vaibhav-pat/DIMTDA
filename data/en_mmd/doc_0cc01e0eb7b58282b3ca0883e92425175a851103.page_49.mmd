MAN
Uh, what was your dad wearing?

BARTENDER
Whaddyu mean?
MAN
Well, when you’re carrying people one-by-one across

the Brooklyn Bridge, you tend to get exhaustingly
familiar with them.

BARTENDER
Uh... I dunno what he was wearing—You remember
what every person had on?

MAN
It’s along bridge. Took me almost a month to get
everyone off it as the laser was approaching. You...
I don’t know.

BARTENDER
Oh! Y’know what? Brown leather jacket. And, uh,
I think also a Nets cap. We got a picture of him off
some kind of article.

MAN
I think... I think I remember somebody like that.

BARTENDER
Shut up. No, you don’t.
