Abstract

Tris study explores the perceptions and behaviours of drivers that pertain to cruising for
parking and their impact on the time of cruising for parking. A survey was conducted with
rivers in the Southbank distict of city of Brisbane, Australia through face-to-face
interviews. This district is Brisbane's cultural and recreational precinct and one of most
popular tourist attractions where severe congestion is frequently seen during the afternoon
eak-hours because of visitors and commuting trafic. The survey reveals that potential
ferors in drivers’ perception of the parking cost are one of the major drivers of the cruising
‘behaviour and drivers are not necessary well informed about parking costs, even when they
claim to be familiar with these costs. We also demonstrate that the on-street parking premium
could be much larger than our common assumptions and a significant contributor to the
increased cruising time. Failing to reflect the premium factor in parking pricing will
depreciate the effectiveness of pricing-based strategies to mitigate the cruising for parking

‘The economics of parking and associated driver behaviour have recently attracted increased
research attention. This may have been caused by recognition of parking policies as an
‘effective management option to ease travel demand without social opprobrium resulting from
‘other altematives such as congestion pricing or road tolling. Recent studies also cast more
light on ‘cruising for parking” phenomenon, which is a common and natural behaviour of
<ivers to search for more affordable and convenient on-street parking. Cruising for parking
