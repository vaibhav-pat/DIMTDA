Pacific Highway Wyong Town Centre

Pacific Highway is the main route through the Wyong Town Centre and is a major urban
arterial road connecting the northern suburbs of the Central Goast. The Commonwealth and
NSW Governments are investing $420 milion to upgrade the Pacific Highway through the
Wyong Town Centre.

‘This upgrade will duplicate the Pacific Highway to two lanes in each direction between
Johnson Road and Cutler Drive at Wyong, and replace the Wyong River Road bridge with
‘wo new road bridges.

Iwill also integrate the ral interchange with bus services, taxi services and disabled and
‘short-term parking, provide new signalised intersections at Rose Street, Anzac Avenue,
North Road and Cutler Drive, and upgrade the existing intersection at Church Street, and
replace the Rose Street rail bridge.

‘The upgrade will:

‘+ improve safety for all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.

‘+ improve trafic flow to provide reliable road access to and through Wyong town centre

‘+ provide a road environment that maintains as far as practicable the town's identity while
providing opportunites for future revitalisation and growth

‘+ ensure the highway upgrade is compatible with current and future public transport
services, and

‘+ provide improved facilites for pedestrians and cyclists.
