Kinfolk is a café and catering bu
established on a volunteer basis to see if business could be part of the
‘solution towards creating more inclusive communities.

‘The social enterprise provides training and skills to people who face barriers to
traditional employment, while passing on all profits from the business to charity
partners.

‘They work with people from different demographics, including people with disability
and other disadvantaged members of the community, such as people exiting the
criminal justice system.

CEO Jarrod Britfa seeks to create a more inclusive community by tailoring each
volunteer's training to their own needs and desires.

“Our program doesn't have a start or end date, as the goals and needs of individuals
are vastly different, Jarrod says.

‘All the training we do is very hands on and we work alongside our volunteers so
they can realise their goals — which in a lot of cases is moving on to employment.”
‘And for many of their workers, this is exactly the outcome they achieve, with 76 per
cent of volunteers who were seeking employment being successful in getting jobs
during the past 12 months.

For Jarrod, social procurement initiatives will help to provide the foundation for a
sustainable business and allow the enterprise to grow and create more volunteer
placements.

Kinfolk is currently crowdtunding to expand into a second café in Carlton North,

‘greater structure around their training through partnerships with a Registered
Training Organisation, to offer accredited training,

‘For social enterprises like us, i's about encouraging organisations to think about

what they do with their incidental spending,’ Jarrod says.
