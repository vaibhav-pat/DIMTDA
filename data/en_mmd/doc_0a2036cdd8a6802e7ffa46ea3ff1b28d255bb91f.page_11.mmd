Fetal dystocia: Assess for malposiion, CPD, and macrosomia
'* Reposition fetus: Upright and forward leaning postions, walkimovement, pelvic
rock, lunge, hands and knees. Suggest frequent position change (q 30 min," (See
‘Appendix C: Upright Positioning During Labor)
‘Ifthe preceding measures do nat improve fetal position andlor dation: Assess
{otal positon by ultrasound, if OP and > 7om dilated, consider manual rotation. (See

Iatrogenic dystoct
‘© Has active labor been diagnosed too early?

Pelvic dystocia: This isa diagnosis of exclusion and should not be made prior to investigating
all other causes.

Note: Operative delivery is not indicated for prolonged labor as long as maternalietal status is
reassuring. When evaluating labor progress consider effacement, station, and rotation in addition
10 cervical dilation

It Active Phase Arrest:
‘© Involve patient and family in care plan and shared decision making
= Management options include:
1. Augmentation:

‘a. Consider oxytocin augmentation and "tincture of time”

'b. Can consider amniotomy as an alternative or adjunct io oxytocin

c. IUPC may be useful in diagnosing adequate forces but is not necessary to
titrate Pitocin.

4. Incases of active phase arrest, wating for a vaginal delivery rather than
doing a cesarean decreases the risk of adverse maternal outcomes without
causing any additional rsk to the newborn.®

2. Cesarean: Consider i pt. meets arrest criteria and rupture of membranes has
already occurred.
