RECOMMENDATIONS

1. This report is provided as an information item to update the Police and Fire Crime
Commissioner (PEC) on the Service's current arrangements for crewing
appliances with both On-call and Wholetime firefighters,

BACKGROUND

2. The Service signed a dispute resolution with the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) in
March 2017. An important aspect (page 7:1(a)) was the implementation of a
Mixed Crewing and Additional Shift Working Policies. Principles for these polcies
were also agreed and included as appendicies. The key parts to this can be found
in Appendix One of this report. These policy documents have now been
completed and agreed with the FBU. Unfortunately that is not the case with the
Fire and Rescue Service Association (F&RSA). The Service is currently waiting to
see if the F&RSA formally “ail to agree’

8. The issue of having On-call and Wholetime Firefighters riding the same appliance
has always been meet with challegnes within the Service. Nationally the FBU
passed a resolution in 2004 which set criteria which local union officials are
instructed to ensure are met, these are listed below; -

‘+ All members of any crew must either in development or competent phase
of their role

‘+ Mixed crewing will not be carried out to supplement wholetime stations or
crews when the approved watchistation strength has not been achieved

+ Allcompetencies must be demonstrated and auditable within IPDS

+ Atno time shall agreement be reached when any mixing of differing duty
system personnel would mean an extended turn out ime of a fire
appliance or specialist appliance
