Asynchronous generator consumes reactive current and gives active current to the
network. Those a capacitive current flows from the mains or from the capacitor bank to the
stator winding to create a magnetic field in the air gap and induce EMF and currents in the
rotor winding.

In addition, the magnetic field of the rotor in the stator winding creates an active current,
active power for electrical receivers.

Conclusion: For an asynchronous machine to operate in generator mode, a reactive
power source is required that generates a rotor magnetic field

‘A scale of possible slip values was at fig. 3.2

‘The disadvantage of asynchronous generators is the large reactive power that they
consume from the network. The value of this power is proportional to the magnetizing
current J5y and can be 25-45% of the machine rated power.

‘Therefore, for the operation of 3-4 asynchronous generators, it is necessary to take the
same power from the network as the power of one asynchronous generator.

If the generator does not work with the network, and works separately, then you need
to install a synchronous generator of the same power as the power of one asynchronous
generator or a set of high-capacity capacitor banks.
