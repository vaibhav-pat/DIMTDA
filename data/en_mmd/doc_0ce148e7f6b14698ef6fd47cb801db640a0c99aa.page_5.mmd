In transformers the parameters of electrical energy change only — value of current and
voltage. But the physical processes in transformers are very similar to physical processes in
of electrical ma-

asynchronous machines. Therefore, transformers are studied in the cours
chines.

In this way Transformer — It is a static electromagnetic device, which is designed to
convert an alternating current of one voltage into an alternating current of another voltage,
but of the same frequency.

‘Transformers consist of a core and windings. Let's draw a transformer.

Fig. 1.2—The magnetic circuit of a three-phase three-rod transformer:
1 ~ rods; 2— overhead yoke; 3 — the lower yoke

‘Transformer core directs magnetic field. Therefore, the core of the transformer that
conducts « magnetic also field is called the «magnetic core» fig. 1.3
