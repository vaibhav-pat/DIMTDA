You don’t! Don’t do that! (after LIZ takes a step

yourself here, right. ..? (to EDWINA) Right? Liz
Taylor doesn’t (pantomime gunshot), right? Liz...

about.

After a moment, TAYLOR crumbles to the
ground, crying.

TENNESSEE

TAYLOR

sorry...

TENNESSEE

TAYLOR
Bette told... I heard about Frank.
TENNESSEE
