Yes, it is! What? (to FRANK) How’d you like Bette?
FRANK
Two’s Company was better. She’s gotta stick to the
screen, honestly. Never tell her I said that. But tell
Tally I said that, if you could.

TENNESSEE
You know Tallulah Bankhead?

EDWINA
I went to your next memory with Frank!

TENNESSEE
No, no. Frank. Capricorn.

EDWINA
Yeah... This is the next thing you remember with
him.

TENNESSEE
What are you talking about? I wouldn’t have
introduced him to Tally until... G-d, years in.

EDWINA
This is... well, I don’t know. This is just the next
thing you remember.

TENNESSEE
There’s... that... no.
