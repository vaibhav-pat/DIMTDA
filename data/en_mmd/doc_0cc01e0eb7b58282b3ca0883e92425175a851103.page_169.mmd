WARHOL
I'm sorry. I shouldn’t be talking. I’ve done enough to
you.

FRANK
What? What did you do?

WARHOL
(looking to TENN) He doesn’t know?

FRANK looks to TENN, who can't look
away. FRANK turns back to WARHOL,
leaps, and strangles WARHOL. CAPOTE
jumps out of his seat, crying out “Stop! Stop
it!” again and again as TENN watches.

TENNESSEE
Frankie, stop... Please just... (shaking his head)
STOP!

EDWINA slams the machine and the scene
freezes.

TENNESSEE
is the last time I saw my boyfriend Frank when
trong enough to leap across a table. Look at
those arms. I remember when they were still that
thick... G-d, just one more—just of us lying around
