The TH, Bridgewater Raynham High School robotics team is a

competitively ranked team in New England. 42 high school students

‘work with 32 mentors to build a 150 pound robot to compete in a

game that will be revealed to us on January 7 by the FIRST

organization. The goals of FIRST are to get high school students

excited to work in Science, Technology, Art, and Mathematics fields.

Mentors work with students to design, build, and fabricate robots,
using state of the art tools and software packages that prepare them for future careers in these
fields. Students also learn to present themselves and their work through a variety of media
platforms. The team then travels to multi day competitions as far away as Houston, TX for the
World Championship that we qualified for and attended last year.
