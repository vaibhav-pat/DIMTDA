offset of antenna boresights between IMT BS and FS receiver will also ensure that the protection
criterion is met.

‘Statistical studies for the aggregated case show that for different antenna heights of FS receiver
(rom 10 to 40 meter, a separation distance of 720 m from a FS receiver at 10 m will ensure that
the protection criteria are met, in general, without separation distances for the aggregate case.

In summary, despite a strong interference potential when an IMT BS is located precisely in the
FS receiver antenna boresight direction, the potential interference to FS receiver is limited and
sharing would be feasible.

‘The main coexistence problem in practice is likely to be with fixed links. The E-band plans for
fixed links uses 71-76 GHz paired with 81-86 GHz. Links in the E-band ae likely o be operated
in the same urban and busy areas as IMT. As MBB data rates increase, the band will play a key
role in providing backhaul for 4G and 5G. Therefore, the fixed service should be maintained and
protected in this band.

‘Sharing the band between FS links and IMT access is feasible due to the excellent spatial isolation
Which can be achieved in this band,

‘The TGS/I results show that for antenna heights of the FS system higher than 10 m, the
interference from the IMT system into the FS station would be below the threshold (Study C in
the Atachment 1 to Annex 12 to Task Group 5/1 Chairman’s Report). For an FS antenna height
(of 10m, a separation of 720 metres would be required (see figure below. copy of FIGURE C-2 in
the Chairnsan’s report)

UN curves at the FS receiver from the IMT network,

Inthe light of this, there would be two alternative approaches to protect FS, one for scenarios
Where the FS antenina is above 10 metres and one for scenarios with FS untenna below 10 metres:

‘Scenario 1: Spatial vertical is
