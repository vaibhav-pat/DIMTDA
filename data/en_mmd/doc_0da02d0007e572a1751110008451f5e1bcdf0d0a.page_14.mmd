Parents Handbook

Parental Involvement

Parental involvement is very important to us at Plays Cool, Parental involvement in
‘a childcare service has many benefits for all concerned:

‘+ The children learn from a very young age the importance of education and
that their parents and childcare workers have an interest in the well being.

‘+ The parents become familiar with the environment their child is being
‘educated in and also the staff who work with their children on a daily basis.

‘+ The childcare service gets to know the family as a unit, which in turn improves
the communication between the service and the family.
