‘VALUATION CHALLENGE 99

we discussed previously, fully analyzing which retrospective formula should be
used is beyond the scope of this Article, but we tentatively recommend the Land
formula (though perhaps combined with some guardrails and/or
alternative equitable adjustment methodologies), which is:

‘Tax Due = 5)(1 ~ (SPY (4.1)

Where 5) isthe pre-tax sales price, Pis the assets” basis, and ris the (absolute value
(of the) applicable tax rate

‘The main text refers readers to this Appendix for further details on our
‘weatment of assets with interim payments. The availability of an ULTRA greatly
simplifies the calculations otherwise required by Land's method. We propose that
When interim payments are made, the taxpayer be treated as settling a portion of
the ULTRA equal to the amount of the interim payout (but taxes due could be
‘capped at some share of the interim payment, such as perhaps 50 percent). For
‘example, if there isa 10 percent ULTRA in place and a $I million interim payout,
the taxpayer would owe $100,000 in tax. Since our proposal is limited to top
bracket taxpayers, we should not need to worry about progressive rate structures.
But ifthe top marginal rate changes overtime, the applicable tax rate for calculating
the ULTRA should be the rolling average of the rates prevailing during the holding
period.

‘To maintain full neutrality with regard to the timing of sales, prepayments
should reduce the sale price used in computing Land's formula, This is because if
the government is going to hold a taxpayer’s prepayments until sale, the
‘government must pay interest atthe taxpayer's internal rate of return, otherwise
taxpayers could have an incentive to sell quickly in order to claim their (potential)
rebate. Luckily, this is easy to implement. A prepayment is the equivalent of a
tive dividend (or, even more simply, we can define a distribution from an
ULTRA account as the net amount after any tax prepayments required as a result
of the distribution). At the time of sale, the sale price would thus be reduced by the
