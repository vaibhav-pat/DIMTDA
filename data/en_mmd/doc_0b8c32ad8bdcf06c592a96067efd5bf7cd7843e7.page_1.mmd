‘An antenna tuner unit (ATU) can change the impedance that a feeder
presents to the transmitter, and that when correctly matched, the ATU
may reduce harmonic radiation.

Know that the gain of an antenna is measured in dB, and understand how to ealeulate
the exp. for a known RF power and antenna gain in multiples of 3 4B),

Know that a three-element Yagi has a half-wave driven element, a reflector that is
slightly longer than the driven element and a director that i slightly shorter thaa the
driven element.

Know that Yagi antennas may have more than one director.

Know that electromagnetic radiation comprises both an electrical field and a magnetic
field.

Know that the wo fields are at rightangles to each other and thatthe direction of
propagation is at rightangles to both fields

Know that itis the electrical field that defines polarisation ofthe wave.

Know that VHF and UHF signals will normally be received best when the transmitter
‘and the receiver have the same antenna polarisation.

Know that polarisation i les important at HF due the effects of ionospheric
reflection

Know the concept of an antenna polar diagram,

Know how to recognise the directions of maximum and minimum radiatio
Know how to recognise polar diagrams for he half-wave dipole and yagi antennas.
Know the use of a dummy load and its construct

5a Feeder basics
5a.1 Be able to identify and recall the use of coaxial and twin feeders.

Coaxial feeder is an unbalanced feeder

Coaxial feeder or coax as it is known for short is a cable which as a
generalization looks on the outside like any other round cable. Whilst the basic
construction of the cable remains the same its size can vary from a few mm.

diameter up to say 50mm depending upon the frequency it is to be used.

It is only when you open it up that you see the construction.

Dielectric

Outer jacket

Close woven braid — nner conductor

‘There is an inner core which carries the signal, then a layer of polythene or air
spaced dielectric, on top of that is an outer braid which for good quality coax is
