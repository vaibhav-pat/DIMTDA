Autotransformers are single-phase and
three-phase. Sometimes in three-phase net-
works, three single-phase transformers are in-
stalled, which are connected with a star or delta,

Depending on the inclusion of the autotransformer windings, an increase or decrease
in voltage can be obtained.
Autotransformers are adv’

ble to use fora slight decrease or increase in voltage, when
a reduced current is set in the common part of the winding for both autotransformer circuits

‘This allows for thinner wire wrapping and saves non-ferrous metal. At the same time,
the consumption of steel for the manufacture of a magnetic circuit decreases, the cross sec~
tion of which is less than that of a transformer.

Disadvantages of autotransformers
1) The disadvantage of the autotransformer is the need to isolate both windings for a
higher voltage, since the windings are electrically connected.
2) The operation of three-phase power transformers is allowed with a transformation
ratio of no more than 2.0-2.3. For example, 220/110 kV is allowed and 220/750 kV is not
allowed.
