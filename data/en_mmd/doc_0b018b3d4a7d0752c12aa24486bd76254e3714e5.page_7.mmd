3. Discussion

3.1 Parking Information
Ithas been discussed in earlier iterature that knowledge on parking conditions is an important
determinant of cruising behaviour, and better informed drivers wil choose to avoid cruising
‘A common assumption of existing theory also has been that drivers can make informed
<ecision on parking costs provided they know the costs structure and the parking conditions
(Teng ot al, 2002). In the real world seting, however, divers unlikely to possess the perfect
knowledge of the parking cost and the prevailing parking condition. The information of on:
street parking availabilty is yet readily available to drivers. Parking fees fluctuate by location,
time of day, day of week, and duration of stay, which facilitates. substantial errors in assuming
the actual parking cost for drivers.
