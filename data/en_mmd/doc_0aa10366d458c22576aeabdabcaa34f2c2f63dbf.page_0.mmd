GODEL, ESCHER, BACH

We finally got to reading Goedel, Escher, Bach: The Eternal Braid and found it
fascinating, an example of Fort's philosophy that everything's connected to everything
else.

We haven't yet proved if there is an even number which is not a Goldbach number, i. e.,
‘the sum of two odd primes, We did however device a chaotic number system based on
‘the Wondrous numbers.

All the integers we've tried so far pass the Wondrous Number Test: If odd multiply
by three and add one. If even divide by two. Continue until you reach one.
For example, 1 = 20(22-1)/3, 2 = 21, 3 = 20(21(24-1)/3-1)/3, 4 = 22, 5 = 20(24-1)/3, 6

= 21(21(24-1)/3-1)/3, etc.

Designating the operations in this way can be abbreviated to just the exponents to give:
1220,2=1,3=410,4=2,5= 40,6 = 4ll, 7 = 432110, 8 = 3,9 = 4321120, 10 = 41, 11=
43210, 12 = 412, 13 = 430, 14 = 432111,

‘There's a pattern but it is complex. It’s a chaotic generator.

Then there's the Vinogradov numbers, odd numbers above V, which are the sum of
three primes. (We haven't found V yet either.)

‘The recursive acronym was another interesting idea. GOD, for example, was expanded
to GOD Over Djinn, which in turn could be further expanded to GOD Over Djinn Over
Djinn, GOD = GOBOD = GOOGOD =

‘The heterarchy was another new idea for us. It can branch like an ordinary hierarchy
but it can also loop back on itself to make recursive transition network (RTN).

Elsewhere we came across the handy word "blik" and “clang”. A blik is one of those.
unalterable beliefs that transcend the mere facts made possible by them, like the
paranoid’s "They all hate me!” or the uniformitarian’s "The future will be like the past.”
