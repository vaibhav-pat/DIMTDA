Graph 12: Differences in 10-Metre Acceleration Times in All Subjects Across The

Three Products

Graph 12, shows in general the Trusox and Modified Trusox out performed the Football
Sock for the majority of the subjects. Additionally, the graph also shows the Trusox
largely outperformed the Modified Trusox in the majority of the testing, albeit marginally.

Conclusion

‘This study for its primary purpose, showed that during a test of agility (AT) using the
‘same subjects with repeated testing under the same conditions the Trusox showed an
average improvement against a traditional team kit Football sock, by 12.5%.
‘Additionally all subjects recorded a greater performance wearing the Trusox than a
Football Sock, with a greater degree of potential improvement corresponding to the
‘subjects abil to perform the test. This would have large implications upon professional
football players, who feasibly would have greater agility performances. Of great concem
is the potential slippage and performance deficit that is possible within the standard
team kit sock, when arguably the athlete is required to execute repetitive explosive
movements during games. Such slippage at intense speeds may also lead to a greater
risk of injury, but is behind the scope of this paper.

In relation to the secondary aim of this study, both 20-metre and 10-metre acceleration
times are drastically decreased when performed using the same subjects wearing
‘Trusox compared to Football socks. In conclusion the Trusox product does appear to
