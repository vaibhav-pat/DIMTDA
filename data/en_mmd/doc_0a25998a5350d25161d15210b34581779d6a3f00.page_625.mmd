126 The Radically Different Conceptual Repertoire of
Human Beings

[nny comments: this sub-ttle mirrors exactly the relationship between the mid-EW and the bra

126 Into our mental lives there entered a dramatic quality of open-endedness,
an essentially unlimited extensibility, as compared with a very palpable
limitedness in other species.

Concepts in the brains of humans acquired the property that they could
get rolled together with other concepts into larger packets, and any such
larger packet could then become a new concept in its own right. In other
words, concepts could nest inside each other hierarchically, and such
nesting could go on to arbitrary degrees.

[llere we have the mindfife-EW and the brain inthe macro-EW. in my article identify mind
with fife!)

129 My overall point, though, is that we humans, unlike other animals, have
all these kinds of memories; indeed, we have them all in spades. We recall in
great detail certain episodes from vacations we took fifteen or twenty years
ago. We know exactly why we are frightened of certain places and people.
We can replay in detail the time we ran into so-and-so totally out of the blue
in Venice or Paris or London. The depth and complexity of human memory is
staggeringly rich. Little wonder, then, that when a human being, possessed of
such a rich armamentarium of concepts and memories with which to work,
turns its attention to itself, as it inevitably must, it produces a self-model that
is extraordinarily deep and tangled. That deep and tangled self-model is what
â€œT"-ness is all about.
