Meeting Norms

To encourage a space of inclusion and diversity, WG members were asked to agree
Upon the following meeting norms:

Make space, take space (share the mic).
Stories shared here stay here; what is learned here leaves here.
Share your unique perspective: share your unpopular opinion.
Generative thinking: ‘yes, and! instead of “yes, but’.

Listen from the "We", speak from the *

Offer what you can; ask for what you need.

Be inquisitive

Assume best intent and hold each other accountable.

Be empowered to share impact.
