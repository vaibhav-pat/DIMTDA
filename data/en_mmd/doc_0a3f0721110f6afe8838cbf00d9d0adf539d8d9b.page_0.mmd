COVID-19 RULES AT CAMP IDYLWOOD

I . understand that living in the era of coronavirus
(hereafter referred to as COVID-19) carries many risks and requires.
following rules to keep myself and others safe.

| understand that my welcome at camp depends entirely on my willingness
to follow these rules. For example, when a counselor reminds me to step
away from another or not to touch another's things, | will do so immediately
and will not complain. | will never argue with my counselor about these
rules.

| understand that while I may be completely healthy, | may have touched
‘something that other people might have touched. Because | do not know
how many hands have touched something, | might be exposed to COVID-
19 by handling things that are not mine at camp.

| understand that | must follow all these rules, even if they seem silly to me:

+ [will wash my hands immediately upon arrival to camp with the anti-
bacterial soap in the kitchen

‘+ Lill place my lunch in a sealed zip lock bag provided by Idylwood
Stables; my counselor will store it in the fridge. | may not open or
close the fridge. My counselor will get me what I need.

‘+ I will wear my mask at all times, except when eating lunch, drinking
water or Gatorade, or riding my horse. If | misplace my mask during
lunch or while riding, | will immediately tell my counselor who will
bring me a clean one.

‘+ I will not stand closer than six feet to any other camper at any time
+ Iwill use only those things provided by my counselor — | will not

“borrow” another camper's things (grooming brushes, saddle pad,
books, pens, etc)
