Step 2: Build a Team

Purpose and Objectives

This guide provides steps for establishing
land growing a school team focused on
family engagement. The Partnerships for
Literacy team gives teachers, families,
‘and administrators a place to work
together to support literacy. The team
‘assesses what your school is already
doing to support literacy at home and in
the community, and develops a plan for
improving these supports so all children
will develop the skils they need,

‘The Team provides a meaningful and
targeted opportunity for your schoo! to
include families in your school
leadership, meeting ESSA Title |
‘accountabilities for partnering with
families to evaluate and develop a
‘school plan for family engagement.

‘The Team provides a place for families
to share their expertise and experiences,
and to have a voice and ownership in
decision-making and planning,

‘The Partnerships for Literacy team also
provides a place for families of children
with disabilities to provide feedback, and
help to improve the schools facilitation of
parent involvement (IDEA, Part C and

8). Families on the team bring
perspectives and knowledge that will
benefit programs for their children, and
for other families in their community

‘As your school develops tiers of support
for learning and behavior, known as a
Multi-Tiered System of Supports, families
are critical partners.

With your Partnerships for Literacy team
you will have the experts you need:
parents and caregivers, teachers and a
school leader, to create a local plan to
support early literacy and learning for
young students,

Getting Started

‘School leaders can begin by
considering who in your school and
community would make the best team. It
will be helpful to invite a parent
caregiver you already have a working
relationship with to co-plan the who,
what, when, where, and why of this
team. Together you can identity
individuals who currently have
experience related to your primary
goals. For example, Partnerships for
Literacy teams are focused on
language and literacy goals, so
parents/caregivers with children from a
variety of literacy levels and
backgrounds should be invited along
with school staff and community
partners with a literacy focus.
