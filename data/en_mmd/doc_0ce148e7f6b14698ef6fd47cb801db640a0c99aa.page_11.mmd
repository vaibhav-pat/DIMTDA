‘The beginning of the low voltage vector is connected to the beginning of the high volt-
age vector. The direction of the low voltage vector will show the group of winding connec
tions.

‘The winding group of connection depends on:

1) Of the number of the transformer phases.

Single-phase transformers have only first and s
transformers may be having 12 groups.

2) From winding connection diagram.

3) From marking the ends of the windings.

4) From winding direction of windings.

In industry, only two groups of winding connections are used — zero and eleven.

Ifthe 1g connection schemes are the same, the group will be 0, if different — it

th groups. Three-phase two-winding
