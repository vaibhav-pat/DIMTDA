front crawl, back stroke, breast stroke) for those who have successfully achieved the!
preceding foundational skills (breathing, submersion, floating, gliding). In addition, swimmers.
should be introduced to proper race start methods, and in-water turns. Throughout the Basic
Stage, movements should be repeated by both athletes and coaches, and directions should be
simple and easy to follow. Finally, basic life skills such as perseverance, enthusiasm,
concentration, stress-management, creativity and cognitive development should be
instructed and emphasized at the Basic Stage.
