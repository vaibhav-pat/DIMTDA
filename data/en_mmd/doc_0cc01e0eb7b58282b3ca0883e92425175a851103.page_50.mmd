MAN
Yeah, uh...! New shoes? Red Nikes?

BARTENDER
Oh, my G-d. He’s got an old pair of Red Nikes—
wears *em everywhere—says they’re lucky. You
remember my pop!

MAN
Uh... Ido! Yeah!

BARTENDER
I dunno how ya lifted that guy! Is everyone just
weightless when ya stop time?

MAN
Uh, no—People are still... If they’re heavy, you
have to drag them, unfortunately. Some people get
scraped up, but...

BARTENDER
Fucking better than dead! Y’know what—We were
saying the reason we knew that Angela girl was lying
is cuz if time’s stopped, you're frozen. You can’t
move your own parts. So, I mean—not to be crude
but, come on, y’know? Nothings going up there. It’s
frozen shut. Like a statue.
