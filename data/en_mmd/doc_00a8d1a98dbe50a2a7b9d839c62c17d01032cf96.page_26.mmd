‘A court can award costs when there has been a marked and unacceptable
departure from the reasonable standards expected of the prosecution: A v Fercan
Developments, 2016 ONCA 269 at para 72-77; see also Rv Singh, 2016 ONCA
108 at paras 29-38.

In criminal cases, the purpose of a costs award is not primarily punitive or
compensatory, but rather to ensure that an accused is not deprived of the
‘opportunity to advance a defence because of the cost associated with Crown
misconduct: Rv Villani, 2020 ONCA 436, at para 117

a) Costs for Bystanders

‘The differences between an accused and a bystander may justify a lower threshold
{for Grown misconduct leading to costs:

+ First there is a significant access to justice Issue as a bystander may incur
significant legal costs to enforce his or her Charter rights.

+ Second a bystander is in a more vulnerable position than an accused
person since the rules of criminal procedure, which afford accused persons
procedural protections, are not available to bystanders.

+ Third, the rationale for limiting costs awards in favour of accused persons
to cases of Crown misconduct does not apply with the same force to
bystanders: A v Martin, 2016 ONCA 840 at para 51; see also Fercan
Developments
