‘The combined winding is the sum of the wave and loop windings
Anchor winding parallel branches

‘The most important difference of windings is the number of parallel branches. Simple
‘wave windings have two parallel branches (a = 1) always, where a is the number of pairs of
parallel branches (fig. a)

Simple loop windings have the number of parallel branches a=p, (a is equal to p) where
is the number of pole pairs of the machine (fig. b).

Combined windings are the sum of a simple wave winding and a simple loop winding,
In these windings a=p, due to the presence of a loop winding (fig. c)

Complex windings have two and three strokes.

Leveling conductors

In the manufacture of machine designs, asymmetry occurs. Therefore, in the parallel
branches of the windings may be different currents. These currents must be equalized before
coming into the collector. To do this, use leveling conductors.

Only for wave windings do not use leveling conductors, because they have only two
parallel branches. And different currents in the wave windings are aligned along this wind-
ing.

‘Therefore, the choice of anchor winding always begins with a simple wave wind-
ing

If you want to increase the number of parallel branches of the anchor winding, use loop
or combined winding, In combined winding leveling conductors do not use because it has,
the wave sections and different currents are aligned along the winding.

An increase in the number of parallel branches may be necessary to reduce the current
of a parallel branch
