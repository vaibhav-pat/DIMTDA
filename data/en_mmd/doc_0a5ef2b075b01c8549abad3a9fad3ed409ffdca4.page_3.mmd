Stay Connected at The Holy Way

“Sermon Debrief Bible Study in person on Campus and Zoom”
- Tuesday 10:00 a.m

It's Both! Come and meet live in the Conference Room at 10:00 a.m. or join on
Zoom and we will conference you in on the big screen!

This is a great way to get to Fellowship, wrestle with questions about Sunday's
sermon, ponder the meaning of God's Word, and discover how Scriptures can
transform our lives today. This is led by Pastor Tina and is interactive! Come join
the live class if you are able!

“Thoughtful Thursdays” - Thursday 10:00 a.m. Zoom

This is a great way to stay connected (especially for our snowbirds, and folks that
can't make it to in-person services!). We share about our lives, spend time talking,
share joys, prayer requests...and anything else that comes up. Oh yes, laughter
‘seems to happen too. This is group led, with Pastor Tina and for women AND men!
