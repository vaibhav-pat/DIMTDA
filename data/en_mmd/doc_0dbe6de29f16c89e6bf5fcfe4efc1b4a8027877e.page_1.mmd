Â» But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you
endured a great conflict of sufferings, * partly by being made a public
spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming
sharers with those who were so treated. * For you showed sympathy to
the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property,
knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting
one.
