existing at that moment is caused to go out of existence atthe same time. There is thus no general

‘cause for the cessation of the physical universe at that moment ~ its ceasing to exist is simply the

mass effect of all of these i

lividual extinction-events taken together. Such a concatenation of
‘events would be highly improbable, but hardly impossible. It could happen, in principle, in the

actual world. As such, the going out of existence of the physical

diverse is not just physically

possible —it is metaphysically possible as well

Ofcourse, many people nowadays, including apparently most scientists, affirm a physical
‘cosmology according to which the physical universe in which we live is neither beginningless nor

everlasting, but which came into existence with the “Big Bang” and governed by an internal

mechanism operating to insure the “heat death” of the physical universe and is cessation without
remainder ina finite petiod of time. On this scenario, the physical universe in which we live i
itself a metaphysically contingent state-of-affairs, whose ceasing to exist is in fact, physically
predictable given the initial state of that universe after the “Big Bang.” the amount of matter it
contains, andthe expansion rate ofthe universe. In that ase, after the “heat death ofthe univers,
nothing will exist and there wil be no prospect of “restarting” the physical univers, so that it will

cease to

thout remainder, and without generating any sort of successor universe to take its

place. Atleast, so many people presently believe. However, given the instabi

beliefs about cosmological matters, I will not depend in this context on the actual tuth of any such

‘account. Nevertheless,

if this account is in fact true, then the metaphysical cont

‘physical universe is entailed by its physical contingency.

‘The point to be emphasized here is that, in envisaging the metaphysical poss

‘physical universe might cease to exist we ate not considering a merely abstract or purely “logical”

‘event of state-of-affairs for whi

possibility. We are envisaging we can conceive of
