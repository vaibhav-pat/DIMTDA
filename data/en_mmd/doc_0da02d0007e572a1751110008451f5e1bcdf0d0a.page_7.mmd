Parents Handbook

Curriculum

‘The schedule of activities planned for the preschool age group is reviewed regularly
based on the interest of the children. Much of the day is taken up with free play
which is interspersed with short periods of structured activities.

During a free play session the children decide for themselves what materials they
‘would like to play with. Materials are easily accessible on low-level shelves and the
child is free to move about, see what choices are on offer, and make a decision
about what they will engage in

‘At this age children are not expected to sit for long periods and their need to move
about frequently is respected and reflected in the layout of their environment.

Structured activities for children include:

+ Creative art — painting, colouring, cutting gluing
+ Songs, music and dance

+ Drama

+ Books, Story time

+ Outdoor play

+ Sand Play

+ Water Play

+ Home Comer

+ Cars, Trains, train tracks

+ Construction Play — blocks, Lego

+ Circle time

+ Tabletop Work - pegboards, play dough, threading

Children are encouraged to put materials away after they have played with them,
