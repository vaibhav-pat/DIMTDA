Things That Have Existed

Since the Beginning of the World

27 Following and radicalizing
Kant, constructionists will confuse, without residues (i

also abolishing the noumenon), ontology with epistemology:
what there is (and is not dependent on conceptual schemes)
and what we know (and depends on conceptual schemes),

33 This is clear proof of the fact that
if we abandon the reference to an external world that is stable

and independent of schemes, then everything is possible, since

this decision comes to interfere with practical decisions (political

and moral) and not only with theoretical observations. It

certainly can be argued that ontology is not what there is, but

it is the discourse on what there is. So there is always an epistemological
remnant in ontology and an ontological residue in

epistemology. This is indisputable: ontology is never without
epistemology, just as one cannot live without knowledge.
