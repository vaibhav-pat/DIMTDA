For transformers with oil cooling systems using nitrogen or carbon dioxide in the surge
tank to protect the oil from oxidation by air (“protected”), add the letter “P”.

Now such transformers sometimes do without an expantion tank, Fig. 1.2.

Such transformers are performed in an airtight version with a full filling of the tank
with oil. Oil expansion during heating will be due to the movement of the ribs on the tank (

Consider the design of the oil transformer.

‘Tanks of power transformers are made of sheet steel

il in transformers is used for insulation and cooling. The oil ages during the opera-
tion of the transformer and loses its initial insulation properties. It is affected by oxygen,
water, dirt and heat, Fig. 14.

‘The windings of transformers are made of electrical copper or aluminum of rectangular
or circular cross-section. Cylindrical and screw windings are often used. They are separated
from the core, from each other and from the walls of the tank by cylinders of insulating
‘material (Bakelite).

‘You must understand why the voltage is increased at power plants before being trans-
ferred to consumers.

! The voltage is increased in order to reduce the current.
