‘extraction of data from victims’ mobile phones are deterring rape victims from seeking
justice through the criminal justice syste.

‘The power contained in the Bill does not reflect the requirements of Article 8 ECHR and
the Data Protection Act 2018, and may fail to prevent unnecessary and insufficiently
‘specific extraction requests, that breach the right to privacy of victims of crime and inhibit
‘access to justice. The provisions that permit agreement to data extraction on behalf of
‘adults who lack capacity do not require any consideration of their views, contrary to
protections in the Mental Capacity Act 2008, and the requirement to respect the ‘will and
preferences’ of the individual who lacks capacity under Article 12 UNCRPD. This risks
undermining important safeguards for the right to privacy of disabled persons.

To ensure clarity and compliance, the limits of the power should be set out in the Bil. It
is important that safeguards and definitions are not left to a Code of Practice, particularly

as the Bill excludes criminal or cul ability for breach of the Code.°S
Given the intrusive nature of searches of devices, we are further concerned at the range
cof persons authorised to extrac information
‘The Commission advises the Government to amend the Bill to:

+ Specify that data extraction powers should only be exercised where ‘strictly

necessary’, that free and informed consent is required rather than

‘agreement’ and that extraction requests must only be sought where there
is no less intrusi

extraction should be

;ntified, reasonable and proportionate lines of inquiry.
+ Ensure that indi

iduals can only consent to extraction on behalf of children
under 16 and people who lack capacity where they are individuals who can
reasonably be expected to represent the individual's best interests and the
views of persons who lack capacity are sought and given appropriate
weight.

+ Remove

migration officers from the list of persons authorised to extract,

information from electronic devices.
