Enfield Methodist Circuit

This short act of worship has been produced for you by
Deacon Jacqueline Esama-John.

Ifyou are well enough and able, why not spend a few
moments with God, perhaps at a time when you would
normally be sharing with others in church and pray for them as
they pray for you.

Opening Prayer
Loving God, we have come to worship you.

Help us to remember that you are here with us.
May we pray to you in faith,
sing your praise with gratitude
and listen to your word with eagerness.
through Christ our Lord. Amen
‘The Methodist Worship Book p.27

Be still, for the presence of the Lord, the holy One, is here;
Come bow before him now with reverence and fear:

In him no sin is found - we stand on holy ground.

Be still, for the presence of the Lord, the holy One, is here.

Be still, for the glory of the Lord is shining all around;
He burns with holy fire, with splendour he is crowned:
How awesome is the sight - our radiant king of light!
Be still, for the glory of the Lord is shining all around.

Be still, for the power of the Lord is moving in this place;

He comes to cleanse and heal, to minister his grace:

No work too hard for Him - in faith receive from him.

Be still, for the power of the Lord is moving in this place.
David J Evans (6.1957)

Prayers of Adoration
Holy God,

To you alone belong glory, honour, and praise.

We join with the hosts of heaven as we worship.
You alone are worth of adoration from every mouth,
‘And every tongue shall sing your praise.

You create the earth by your power.

You save the human race in your mercy,

‘And renew it through your grace.

To you, loving God,

Father, Son and Holy Spirit,

Be all glory, honour, and praise
