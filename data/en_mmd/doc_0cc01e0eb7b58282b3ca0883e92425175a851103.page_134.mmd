What did she...?! Oh, Tenn, no matter! Don’t—You
can’t change what—

TENNESSEE
I don’t give a shit!

EDWINA
What happened to—?!

TENNESSEE
I don’t rem—no, I...! I get a call a week later from
her manager saying—apparently—she really wanted
to be the Princess! And that isn’t my g-ddamn fault! I
auditioned a thousand actors and one kills herself;
that isn’t my fault! Plenty of them took it great! Took
it professionally...! I was not too hard on her; this is
a hard business... And it wasn’t like I killed Audrey
fucking Hepburn! It was Diane Barry... Diane
Baritone... Bari...
