‘Owl Pallet Disection-AFTERNOON SESSION

Most birds, lke owls, cannot chew their food. Instead, owls swallow their
food whole. Some materials that owls eat are not able to be digested, and owl
pellets result in undigested materials from animals that the owls ate. The
bones from the undigested animals can be found inthe owl pellets. This
activity allows for the dissection of ow! pellets in order to determine what
‘animals the owls ate. This activity is fun, informative, and safe forall ages to
complete!

Materials Needed:

Owl Pellet Kits will be needed for this session. Please register early so we
can order for your students!
