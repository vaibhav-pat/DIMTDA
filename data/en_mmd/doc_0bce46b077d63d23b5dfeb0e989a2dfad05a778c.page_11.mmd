SUE:
I-itis Luke Snailham, an editor who worked on the documentary.

JARRAH:
‘Awesome. And they/re basically loking through some of Deep Space 8's greatest hits, and the
conceit that they have going i that they're checking off some of the big things that they did that
were like groundbceaking or controversial, So they've addressed war. They've addressed
religion. What was the thicd one on there?

SUE:
| think race was one of them, and the consequences of war was one of them.

JARRAH:
‘And then the last one is a queer representation or LGBTQ: representation. Sue did you want to
talk a litle about that?

SUE:
‘Yeah, I think that ‘pause* again, many feolings.| think that i's nice they/te not letting
themselves off the hook with this one. They'e not saying "Oh well we did that gay episode its
fine.” | also wonder though if they set the bar high enough? Even though they're not letting
themselves off the hook. | think that- again, tm not sure thatthe writing team or the
documentary team realized that they created a trans icon you know?

GRACE:
Yeah. Its amazing that that kind of goes over their heads and-

SUE:
Right. So I mean even though they didnt write it inte the show, there is this sort of lasting result
of the Dax character. There is also- they talk about ike “What ifwe had had or even asked to
have Garak tke fully come out as gay and pursue this relationship and just be this character?"
‘And | thought it was “pause” nice isn't the right word, but it was good to have Ira just flat out say
lke "We didn't even ask. Like we can't give ourselves a pat on the back ifwe didn't even ask
‘even regardless of whether the network would have allowed ths.” But in that same conversation
Luke, our friend Luke, says that Profit And Lace quote “Plays even better now than it did back
then.”

GRACE:
“skeptical to the point that she sounds lke she’s inhaled helium” Does it?

SUE:
‘And that that is quite a eringe-y moment, I thik for everybody here today.
