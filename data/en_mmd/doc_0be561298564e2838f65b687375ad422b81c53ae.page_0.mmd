‘A.9.00am start today against Korea at Green Stadium, regarded as the main field for this
tournament. This was an important game for Korea as they beat Cuba yesterday and soa win
for them today would see them progress into the Super Round.

Declan Croker was our starter and after getting in alittle wouble early in the I giving up a hit
‘and a walk, he did well to get out ofthe innings without any damage. There was the exact same
scenario in the 2 but a double play got us out of it. In the meantime, our hitters were being
challenged adapting to the Korean pitcher's sidearm style of delivery

Korea broke the game open in the 3 on the back of two hits and a combination of walks and
hit pitches which saw three uns cross the plate. Watson came on for Croker ina trcky situation
‘but he did very well to shut them down without any further runs. In the bottom ofthe 3, we
hit back straight away when McCallum singled to right field and he scored on a Lyberopoulos
hit wo centre field. Sevens then line deve singled to right field to score Lylberopoulos and a
hard hit Shephee ball was erred by thei Fist baseman and we had tied the game hack up at
3-3
