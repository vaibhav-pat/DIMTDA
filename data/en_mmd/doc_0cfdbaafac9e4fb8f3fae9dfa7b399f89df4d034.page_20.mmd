‘These agreements can take the form of negotiated agreements such as terms

Lynch
of seblement, separation or medated agreements, or pre-nuptual agreements.

The Courts will usually only get involved to alter this agreement, if such
agreement does not “properly provide” for one party or ifthe circumstances of
one or other of those involved have changed dramatically in the meantime.
Ina similar vein, the Courts have indicated that any windfall or wealth which
one party gets after the couple's relationship has formally ended or, assets
Which were inherited by one party should not automatically be open to a claim
by the other unless they are required to make proper provision or to reflect,
contribution.

IF YOU HAVE A SEPARATION AGREEMENT OR JUDICIAL
SEPARATION — WILL EVERYTHING BE LOOKED AT AGAIN
AT THE DIVORCE STAGE?

‘There are some general guidelines:

> Aprior settlement with a “Yull and final settlement” clause whether by
Deed or Consent can only be varied in the most acute circumstances of
change.

> What are called, “second bite cases", wher there Is an increase in the
other spouse's value are effectively ruled out.

> The terms of applying for further financial relie in changed circumstances
are set out narrowly and are difficult to achieve. The Court does not see
the making of proper privison ans exercise to "redistribute wealth”.

> There has to be a substantial change ~ such as an illness - to justify an
application for further provision. If there is no change, there is no new
provision.
