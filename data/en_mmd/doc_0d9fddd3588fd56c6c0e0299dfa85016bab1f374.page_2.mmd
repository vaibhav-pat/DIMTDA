List three challenges from this biennium.

EClub of Canadat
+ Fundraising ( made more difficult by distance of members)
* Attendance at Conferences and Workshops ( also made more dificult by distance)

Hamiltont

"© With an aging membership, we have fewer individuals willing to participate in service projects and/or
take on leadership responsibilities

‘+ To grow the club’s membership (age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc) that is reflective of the women
in Hamilton,

‘+ Although our club's profile continues to grow in the community we are still an unknown entity to many
‘and as such itis dificult to attract interest in Zonta’s work.

Oakville
* Consistent participation at bingo (this wil ikely get rectified as many of the new members are
getting trained)
+ Loss of some members over IWD committee issues and preference for more social vs.
following bylaws.

sale)
