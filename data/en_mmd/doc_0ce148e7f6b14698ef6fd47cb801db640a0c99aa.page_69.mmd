‘Temperature rise is the maximum temperature minus 40 degrees by Celsius.
‘The DC machines have two main parts, namely:
Stationary part — stator; rotating part — an anchor.
Also included in the design of the machine:
‘Two bearing shields on which the anchor shaft rests; brush device.
Now let’s do a detailed discussion about all the essential parts of DC machine

1) The STATOR is a stationary
part. It consists of a frame (yoke), the
main and additional poles. The termi-
nal box is on the bed. The ends of the
field windi
box. Also on the stator, there are paws
and devices for transportation (eyebolt,
transport lugs).

Construction of DC motor frame
‘The frame (or the bed) of DC machine made up of cast iron or steel and forms an
integral part of the stator (the static part of the machine).
It protects the machine, the main and additional poles are attached to the frame, and
the support flaps are attached to the frame too. The main magnetic flux of the machine goes,
along the frame.
