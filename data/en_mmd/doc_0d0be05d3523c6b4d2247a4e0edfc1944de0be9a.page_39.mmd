ircular Quay Precinct Renewal

Circular Quay Renewal, currently in planning and development, would bring Australia’s
‘Waterfront to the World’ back to life through the most significant redevelopment of the area
since the re-construction of the wharves in the 1940's. The Budget has committed $216.4
million towards refining the pre-concept design options. One of the project options includes
renewing the ageing wharves and train station, ensuring accessibility to everyone, and
delivering a world-class customer experience. The renewal aims to revitalise Circular Quay's
arts and cultural offerings, by showcasing Australia’s Aboriginal, and non-Aboriginal history.
It would provide a refreshed retail and dining experience for one of Australia's most iconic
destinations. The project would be a catalyst for further investment in Sydney, whilst
rejuvenating the city landscape to enliven Australia’s global city

Circular Quay is a critical transport interchange in the heart of Sydney, and the only
interchange in Australia where ferry ight rail, heavy ral, bus, taxi and active transport
converge. It is home to Sydney's busiest ferry hub, one of Sydney's most important train
stations and Australia's main overseas cruise ship terminal
