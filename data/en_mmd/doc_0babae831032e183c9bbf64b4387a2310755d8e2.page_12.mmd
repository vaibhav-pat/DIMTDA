filling materials in order to provide you with a more natural-looking
result and to promote better long-term oral health. There are many
benefits to composite fillings, including:

+ Material that bonds to your tooth to provide more support
for the tooth’s structural integrity

+ Reduced risk of the treated tooth breaking or fracturing in
the future

+ Insulation from temperature changes caused by foods and
beverages

+ Better seals around the edges of the damaged area,
increasing the tooth’s resistance to decay and leaks

+ The ability to correct cavities that are too small for
amalgam fillings to repair

+ Fillings that can be repaired and replaced without being
removed from the tooth

+ No mercury or other metals are used, making the filling
safer

When you receive a composite dental filling, our dentist will carefully
select a filling that matches your natural tooth color to give you a more
beautiful and healthier-looking smile. Fillings can usually be placed in
a single appointment.
