We dont see her doing karate or anything

JARRAH:
ee! like some of those characters are in that montage. So for me it was almost more like, |
don't actually question that those characters are strong women characters on their own. Maybe-
like I think DS8 does have a range of those representations. But what | guess was more the
issue for me is lke, knowing alot ofthe other things that those actresses have said about
playing those roles. Like we know Terry Farrell has had interviews where she says lke "I wish
that Nana and I talked about things other than guys sometimes. Like that seemed to be alot of
‘our scenes together.” And we know that Nana Visitor didnt want to end up with Odo and lke so,
that kind of stuf “pause” it almost felt ike it was kind of ike missing to make way forthe lke
DS9 as a feminist ike success story narrative? Whereas, | think you can still actually argue that
‘out sill have a bit more of a nuanced look.

SUE:
‘Yeah, think that DS9, the show itself, actually does a much better job with its women
characters than this documentary does of explaining that. Right? Because | foe! like the doc is
looking at them surface level. Like "Look at these kickass ladies that we have! Okay, moving
on.” instead of:

GRACE:
Thoy've already checked that box off thelist.

SUE:
“laughs* Right. But | mean, | know Nana talks about it quite abit, about Kira being a terrorist
‘and how you know that wouldn't have played later, you know post 9/11. And we hear Terry
Farrell talk alte bit about when they decided to make Dax more roguish. And some of the
‘special features, the extra fan interviews, tak alot about how Dax was inspiring because she
was so confident in herself. Bu fee! like those comments from the women who played these
characters were not inthe section where they talked about how great the women characters.

GRACE:
‘You got to really wonder which stuff ended up on the cutting room floor because they fet it
‘wasn't entirely relevant to this narrative they wanted to create about Deep Space Nine? And
how much just isnt there because you cant have a five-hour documentary that isn't directed by
ken Bums. *Sue laughs" Oh my God. Can you imagine a Ken Bums Star Trek documentary?
Because now that’s the thing my heart wants more than anything else on earth.

JARRAH:
‘At the end we're definitly going to talk about the, you know, in the credits: spoiler. They poke
{un at some ofthe things they werer't able to make in the dacumentary. So let's tak about the
things that are missing when we get to the end, But | also want a giant Ken Burns special on
Star Trek *Grace laughs" Ken Burns plus a highly diverse team of writers and producers. “ll
