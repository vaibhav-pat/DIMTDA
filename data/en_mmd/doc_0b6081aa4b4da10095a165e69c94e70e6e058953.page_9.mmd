Checklist for employers

Set out below is a non-exhaustive checklist of actions for employers that will help to
promote compliance with Section 60. Its strongly recommended that employers use
this in order to avoid breaching Section 60.

Review recruitment policies, practices and procedures to analyse and ensure

compliance with Section 60.

+ Remove general questions to job applicants and third parties that relate to health
and disability (e.g. questions concerning sickness absence) in recruitment
materials.

+ If seeking references in advance of an offer being made, do not ask for
information about sickness absence.

+ Train employees and instruct agents making recruitment decisions of their
practical responsibilities under Section 60, especially on what they can and
cannot do.

+ Structure the recruitment exercise, so far as is possible, to focus objectively on
relevant and necessary skills, knowledge, abilities and experience, avoiding
reference to health and disability questions that donot fall within legitimate
Section 60 exceptions.

+ Clearly explain why information about disabilty is being sought for monitoring
purposes, spelling out what this information will and will not be used for.

+ Where possible, separate disability monitoring data from other information
provided by job applicants and take all necessary steps to ensure that this
information is not used by those making recruitment decisions.

+ Ask questions about reasonable adjustments relating to the recruitment process.
at the appropriate stage, for example, in the job advert in relation to adjustments,
to completion of forms of CVs; or after shortlsting candidates in relation to
adjustments to tests, interviews or assessments.

+ Clearly explain when exceptions to Section 60 are being used and why you
believe itis necessary to ask disabilty- or health-related questions,

+ Take care to refer candidates to occupational health practitioners only after a job
offer has been made.

+ Provide instructions to occupational health practitioners that discourage adverse
â€˜assumptions being made about disabilly, and enable proper consideration of
reasonable adjustments, where required, resulting in appropriate
recommendations.
