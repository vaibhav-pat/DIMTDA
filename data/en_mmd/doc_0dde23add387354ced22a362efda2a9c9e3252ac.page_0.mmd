‘The Annual Show ~ September 14th 2013,

Well done and congratulations to everyone for producing a really first class
Show this year, in spite of the pretty awful Spring weather. We had nearly
300 entries, which is quite a leap up from previous Shows and it was
pleasing to see so many entries in our new photographic section. The
standard of the exhibits was excellent all round and the Officers and
Committee who get the Show on the road would like to thank all those
visitors who came to see the Show and gave us their support. Some of you
were persuaded to join the Society and hopefully you will be encouraged to
center some exhibits next year. The refreshments were again beautifully done
by Margaret Mattinson and Liz Banks, and their various helpers, this all
‘goes towards making the day so very successful. Mike Hill produced his
usual plant display for those who wanted to buy, which of course included
his honey, so all round a really good day — even the weather improved
during the afternoon.

Mike Hill's Open Day ~ Sunday 18" August.

‘Once again Mike Hill opened his gardens to the public in the afternoon and
attracted a good crowd who enjoyed a stroll round his grounds and bought a
lot of the plants that were on sale. Refreshments were provided and as the
weather was once more quite kind the afternoon passed most successfully.
‘The money raised for the Society amounted to something around £700
which keeps the bank balance in a very healthy state. Mike would like to
thank all those who attended and of course those who helped during the day.

and all we ask is that you keep on coming for all your gardening needs as we
do try to keep our prices competitive. Over the Christmas period the shop
will be closed — from the last Sunday in November until the 2! Sunday in
