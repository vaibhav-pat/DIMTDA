Some time passes as Mrs. Mirakov and the team finally makes progress in
working over the plans and discussing the aircraft's requirements,

Elena Gonzales excuses herself to the powder room and on returning ~ sees a
large shadow race across the hall floor followed by a swoosh sound. She goes to
the window and finds the kid (Mikael) sitting on top of a Henry Moore sculpture
working a remote control. A few seconds later, she spies a five-foot diameter
military style drone hovering above the pool. She then sees a housekeeper
frantically running across the lawn. The kid responds by quickly moving the drone
inher path and chasing her in the other direction,

Elena, in disbelief over what she's witnessing ~ temporarily forgets about the
meeting in favor of watching the ridiculous scene play oul. Also, certain no one
will ever believe her ~ she retrieves her phone and starts videoing scene.

‘Again and again the young housekeeper tries to escape to the house ~ but is
‘stopped by the drone ~ an ominous flat black craft with four high-pitched
propellers.

‘After three or four minutes, the git tries to make a run around the end of the pool
= but is strafed again by the drone ~ this time causing her to fallin the pool.

‘On seeing the woman safely pull herself from the water, Elena stops recording
and rejoins the meeting

‘As the meeting is wrapping up, everyone is startled by a loud door slam ~
followed by the sound of wet shoes squishing down the hall. The housekeeper
‘enters the room, sopping wet and yelling in Spanish — her hands flailing. Mrs.
Mirakov looks at her PA as if she should know what's going on. Enid rushes over
to the housekeeper and tries to diffuse the scene.

NEXT AFTERNOON - JRAD offices

‘The entire staff is gathered in the conference room looking at the monitor. Simon
Belzer has taken the video captured with Elena's phone and edited it so it has
the look of a cold war Russian propaganda film. Its replete with Russian subtitles
and stils of Reichmann and Ferris in Russian miltary garb.

‘The group is hysterical with laughter.
