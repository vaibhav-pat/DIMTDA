+ Asa pediatrician that takes care of newborn babies,
Ihave seen firsthand the importance of early
detection of serious medical conditions, like the
ones included on the newborn screen. This bill will
ensure that as advances in newborn screening are
made, that Indiana will be ready to respond and
apply best practices to help keep babies healthy and
safe. Thank you, and I'm happy to answer any
questions at this time

Evaluation:

1. Condition with serious health effects if not detected
at time of birth

2. Is there a safe and effective treatment available to
all

3. Testing is feasible, accurate, available on large scale
