financial year and increased by £0.571m from £0.722m to £1.293m.

Work has continued to develop and QA the detail of the supporting business cases for the
2020/21 Efficiency and Savings Plans. The Strategic Change and Co-ordination Board (SCCB)
considered eight 2020/21 savings business cases on the 26" November 2019 which were
subsequently reviewed and considered by COG wic 2% December 2019. The Efficiency &
Savings Board met on the 9" December 2019 and reviewed the draft Efficiency & Savings Plan,
