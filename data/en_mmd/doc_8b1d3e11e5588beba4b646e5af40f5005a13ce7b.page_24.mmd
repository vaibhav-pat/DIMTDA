abnormal and so accidental conditions). Surely there is a difference, the Bounded Reliabilist,

find myself dissatisfied with Burge’s explanation for the persistence of warrant in demon worlds

Burge’s explanation does not explain to me why warrant should persist in demon worlds.

Burge’s expl

is its “negative”
‘character. By that I mean that Burge’s explanation works (i it does) by arguing (in effect) that

since warrant does not entail truth, it doesn

entail (requite) reliability either (atleast reliability
