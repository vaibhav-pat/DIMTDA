contextual factors that contribute o public meaning, and recontextualization can alter the quality

public meaning is what I will call semantic context, the set of semantic e

presented or juxtaposed with the original object. These semant

entities can be texts, but they

‘can also be other representations or symbols. A third contextual factor is institutional context

‘This refers to the institutional setting ofa semantic object, where an “institution” isa complex of
positions, roles, norms, and values lodged in particular types of social structures and organizing

‘relatively stable patterns of human activity. Unlike in the ease of intended and implicit

meaning, recontextualization can directly alter the semantic and institutional contexts of

honorific representations."

Hence, recontextualization can be targeted at different contextual factors, including

implicit and intended meaning, semantic context, and institutional context. In general, we ean

say that some aet of recontextualization will vary in “strength” with the numberof contextual

honorific representations like the statue itself. A stronger form of recontextualization can aim at
