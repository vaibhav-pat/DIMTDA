ANALOG Real Analog - Circuits 1
DEVICES Chapter 2: Lab Worksheets

2.3.1: Series and Paral
(20 points total)

Resistors and Equivalent Resistance

1 Expected power dissipated by 1KQ resistor (pre-lab analysis). (5 pts)

2. Provide a schematic of the circuit below, including measured resistance values. (3 pts)

|. Measured power dissipated by IKQ_ resistor (provide all measurements taken: actual resistance values,
voltages, currents, povker calculation). Comment onthe agreement between measured and expected power
dissipation ~ calculating a percent difference is always good! (8 pts)

4. DEMO: Have a teaching assistant intial this sheet, indicating tht they have observed your circuit's operation.
