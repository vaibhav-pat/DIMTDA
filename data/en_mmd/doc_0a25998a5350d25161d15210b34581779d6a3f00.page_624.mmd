kind of “life of their own” and that demand — at least when it comes to
extremely finite, simplicity-seeking, pattern-loving creatures like us — a
new vocabulary and a new level of description that transcend the basic level
out of which they emerge.

[my comment: very similar to my mind-EW and difference between this EW and the brain]

117 You also have an “Albert Einstein” symbol, an “Antarctica” symbol, and
a “penguin” symbol, the latter being some kind of structure inside your
brain that gets triggered when you perceive one or more penguins, or even
when you are just thinking about penguins without perceiving any. There
are also, in your brain, symbols for action concepts like “kick”, “kiss”, and
II”, for relational concepts like “before”, “behind”, and “between”, and
so on. In this book, then, symbols in a brain are the neurological entities
that correspond to concepts, just as genes are the chemical entities that
correspond to hereditary traits.

Inmy comment: exactly my correspodence between the mind-EW and the brain structures!!! He
uses even the notion of “correspond” !!1)

118-9 In summary, the missing ingredient in a video system, no matter how
high its visual fidelity, is a revertorre of symbols that can be selectively
triggered. Only if such a repertoire existed and were accessed could we say
that the system was actually Zerce/ving anything, Still, nothing prevents us
from imagining augmenting a vanilla video system with additional circuitry
of great sophistication that supports a cascade of signal-massaging

processes that lead toward a repertoire of potentially triggerable symbols.
Indeed, thinking about how one might tackle such an engineering challenge
is a helpful way of simultaneously envisioning the process of perception in
the brain of a living creature and its counterpart in the cognitive system of

‘an artificial mind (or an alien creature, for that matter). However, quite
obviously, not all realizations of such an architecture, whether earthbound,
alien, or artificial, will possess equally rich repertoires of symbols to be
potentially triggered by incoming stimuli
