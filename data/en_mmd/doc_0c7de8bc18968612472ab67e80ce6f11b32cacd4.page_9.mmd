MORAL BAYESIANISM

‘moral judgement approximately satisfy FA. Our goal in the first two studies was to answer these
questions.

Psychological background

Although we are unaware of any study that has examined moral Bayesianism as a descriptive

thesis, there is a vast psychological literature on meta-ethical questions (e.g, Beebe & Sackris,

2016; Goodwin & Darley, 2008, 2012; Nichols, 2004; Nichols & Folds-Bennett, 2003,
Sarkissian, Park, Tien, Wright, & Knobe, 2011; Theriault, Waytz, Heiphetz, & Young, 2017;
‘Wainryb, Shaw, Langley, Cottam, & Lewis, 2004; Wright, Grandjean, & MeWhite, 2013). The

ccurrent study differs from others in this iterature

only in its subject matter (.e., moral

‘Bayesianism), but also in its methodological approach,

Most studies inthe psychology of meta-thics asked subjects to explicitly report what they
believed to be the correct meta-ethical postion, While providing important insights, these
‘methods also have limitations that philosophers (Pélzler, 2017; Sinnott-Armstrong, 2008) and

psychologists (Beebe & Sackris, 2016) have pointed out. Many empirical studies (e.g.

& Bangji, 2009) have
confirmed that there is often a gap between explicit reports of an internal state and implicit

‘measures of that state. For inst

Jmplicit measures (eg. the Implicit Associat
revealed racial biases in individuals who explicitly report that they do not hold such biases. This
suggests that explicit reports do not accurately reflect paticipant attitudes. It cannot be taken
for granted, then, thatthe explicit meta-ethical reports of participants accurately reflect their
attitudes

Our study, 0 |, does not rely on explicit reports ofthe subjects regarding the

conformity to FA of their moral judgments. As we specify below, we used an inter-subjective
