Areas of Potential Efficiency Gains
Efficiency can be gained by addressing in particular the areas of improvement with
high impact.

Largest use of operational effort

Bites Investigation of middleware client failures
reported eg. by users and of service
misbehavior detected by sites themselves

Experiments Investigation of middleware client failures

Infrastructure Providers Assistance of sites and users with
investigations of middleware failures

Work Area: WGS - Middleware Configuration

Introduction and Overview
‘When queried regarding the middleware, the input from the operators clearly
Indicated that configuration is an area where sites are obliged to invest a large
amount of effort and where a more robust solution would save a lot of time.

Most middleware services are composed of constituent services with diverse
histories and configuration methods. Thus to get the whole ‘appliance’ working a
relatively complex configuration has to be undertaken, The gLite project produced
‘a product called yaim to manage this. The difficulty varies with the service, and
‘there was support for the ARC system as a simple model.
