WARHOL
It sounds like you’re gonna need convincing and my
head’s in my print—so just take the Yellow Snakes.
(re: TENN’s confusion) Drawer.

TENN goes to the drawer, finding pills.
WARHOL holds his hand out. TENN doesn’t
move. WARHOL looks back up to TENN.

WARHOL
If you take them, I can pretend to be Frankie.

TENN doesn't move.

TENNESSEE
Why was I here?
WARHOL
Frankie’s just about gone... You don’t deserve that;
you deserve me.
TENNESSEE
No, I don’t.
WARHOL

You deserve someone who cares about you. I can be
Frankie for you. We can do it right here—I hated this
print anyways; Truman wouldn’t shut up about her.
Let’s ruin her right here.
