‘The galvanostatic cycling data presented in Fig. | are in line with results obtained with CV

measurements, which are presented in the Supporting Information, Fig. S1. In the first eyele

LITFSUDMSO exhibits & lower discharge overpotental, whereas an initially lower recharge
‘overpotential is observed with LiTFS/TEGDME (see Fig. 1.a). The DMSO--based electrolyte
aso exhibits a larger inital discharge capacity of 2024 + 152 mAh ge, which is very close
to that of ca, 2200 mAh ac“ reported fora discharge with LITFSVDMSO using CNT cathodes
‘and comparable current densities [38]. The lower discharge capacities obtained with
LITFSV/TEGDME are in god agreement tothe lower cathodic current densities in the CV (see
Fig. $1). The subsequent discharge capacities decrease exponentially (see Fig. 1b), which is
most probably also ~ but not solely — connected to the incomplete recharges with both

electrolytes visible from the Faradaie efficiencies (see inset in Fig. 1.)
