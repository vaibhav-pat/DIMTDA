TENNESSEE
I don’t want to ruin anyone... not her...

WARHOL
(pulling TENN) Come on!

TENNESSEE
(throwing him off) NO! G-d, no!

WARHOL
(pulling again) Tommy! Just do it!

TENNESSEE
(throwing) You didn’t love me! You just pretended!

WARHOL
(grabbing TENN) What’s the fucking difference to
you, huh? What’s the difference? Who actually loves
you and can get it hard—‘cause Frankie barely fits
half that bill. You wanna feel whole again? You want
love. I’m the best thing you have... (softening grip)
Stop blaming yourself for Frankie being sick. You
blame yourself for everything.

TENNESSEE
1... Ido blame myself for everything.

TENN stops resisting.
