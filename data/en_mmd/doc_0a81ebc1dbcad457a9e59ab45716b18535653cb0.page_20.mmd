“A tale of friendship, love and sacrifice set against the backdrop of a world in
flames..."

Itis July 1916, and as the Battle of the Somme rages, Mametz Wood echoes to the
‘sounds of war as the 38th Welsh Regiment face the ferocity of the German army.
From Owen Thomas, writer of the award winning ‘Grav’, comes a brand-new play
written to commemorate the centenary of the end of World War |. Inspired by a true
story.

Dan and Billy, two young soldiers, forge a friendship in the heat of the build-up to the
infamous battle. When Billy is killed in Mametz Wood, he leaves behind a devastated
fiend and, back home, a heart-broken and pregnant wife.
