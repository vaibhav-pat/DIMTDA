4.5. Annual frequency calibration

Because ofthe diferent parameteisations, resolutions and forcing data used in the GCMs, each
realisation produces a aflerent numberof evens. Inaction, the 20-year period of simulations used
inthe study may not be truly representative ofthe model climatology’ of TC activity. This is due to
interannual to interdecadsl variability impli inthe GCMs, of which a 20-year period may provide only
‘one snapshot

‘The historical baseline is calculated trom the IBTFACS (version 3, revision 4) WMO dataset for 1981 to
2011 inclusive. n some parts othe Pacific, TC activity is modulated by interannual and interdecadal
‘oscilations (e.g. ENSO, POO). This can mean the 31-year record used forthe historical baseline may
not be truly representative of long-term mean TC activity inthe Pace. For example, varying the
‘baseline between 20 and 60 years results inthe mean annual frequency varying by over 1 TClyearin
‘oth the northern and southern hemispheres (Table 4.2).

Note thatthe AIR Worldwide Catalogue derives is statistics trom the Japanese Meteorological Agency
‘TC Best Track dataset in the Norther Hemisphere, which only covers TCs that form west of 180°E.
‘This results in signticant citfrences in mean annual frequency from those presenta here,
