“Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!”
Philippians 4:4

Three Reasons To Rejoice
1.We have hope.

“Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, wel! have
peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have
gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand, And
wellrejoice in the hope of the glory of God.”

Romans 5:1,2
2. God has a purpose.
“... We also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering
produces perseverance.”
Romans 5:3
“Perseverance (produces) character; and character, hope.”
Romans 5:4

3. God is with us.

We rejoice because of what God had done through our Lord Jesus
Christ, who has now made us God's friends.”

Romans 5:11
