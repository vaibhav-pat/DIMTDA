The Class of 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 fll below in both GRE scores in relation to national averages. Inthe previous admission classes. The rend
idenitied is that we struggle to meet the benchmark in relation to GRE scores, though we await most recent data for final comparison,

The GPAs have a higher weighting than GRE in our admissions evaluation process. This can explain why we consistently mect the benchmark in the
GPAs but not the GREs, As class size has increased over the past 4 years GRE scores have remained relatively constant and are very close the national
‘CASPA benchmark averages. The admitted students tend o perform very well in our PA Program, consistently pass PANCE on the first atempt in
accordance with ARC-PA Standards and find employment Presently we do not intend to change our admissions practices, rather we hope to altract more
applicants with higher GRE scores as our program becomes more well-known for producing highly qualified gradustes.

‘Overall, the HPU PA Program is partially meeting the program established goal of recruiting highly “academically” qualified applicants.
