(2) The NSG has three programmes related to management of discipline and incapacity
issues in the workplace. The first is the Grievance and Disciplinary Action Procedures
programme. This programme is accredited by the Public Service Sector Education and
Training Authority (PSETA) against 2 (two) registered unit standards which are 12139 and
11286. The number of public service employees successfully accredited for this
programme is 86 from 2012-2015. The second programme is the Investigating and
Presiding Skills programme. This programme is not accredited, and thus has no
registration number. The third programme is on Policy on incapacity and ill-health
(PILIR). This programme is also not accredited, and thus has no registration number

(8) The NSG conducts training needs analyses on middle and senior management level for
national, provincial and local government entities. Education interventions and capacity
requirements are determined against the senior and middle management competency
frameworks developed by the DPSA as well as specialised competency requirements in
‘areas such as finance, supply chain management and human resources ~ which deal with
issues of managing discipline and incapacity amongst others. Learning and education
programmes provided by the NSG therefore meet the needs of public servants regarding
the management of discipline and incapacity issues within the public service
