Fresh Produce Boxes ~ Terms and Conditions (Our Shared Commitment)

We otter two ways of purchasing our fresh produce boxes ~ subscription and casual. Both are

administrative hassle for both parties of purchasing each week and supports us, your farmers,
with better abilty to plan our crops and pay for upfront costs such as seeds and tools. Our
‘subscription boxes are the most cost effective way to ensure weekly tresh veggies are the
‘orders we fil before any other sales.

Casual boxes are offered each week only if we have additional produce avaliable after we fl
‘our subscription boxes and standing orders for cafes etc. If we have casual boxes availabe in a
siven week, we generally post on facebook (often around Tuesday) to let people know. We
‘charge more for our casual boxes than our subscription boxes, because we want to reward the
loyalty of our subscription customers and our ably to plan and bulk purchase seeds etc for
‘subscription crops means we can offer a lower price for them.
