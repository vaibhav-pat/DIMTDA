wanted to see a college that was a few days away,
told my parents I was visiting my mother’s sister,
when a boy knocked on my hotel room door. Told me
there was no vacancy and he’d pay for mine twice
over. I told him that if there were no vacant rooms I
obviously wasn’t leaving. He agreed that was
reasonable... I was just a girl. I was sixteen and every
boy was terrified of my father’s sermons. But this
town and this boy didn’t know my father; I couldn’t
dare let him leave... I wouldn’t let him sleep in the
same bed as me, which he understood, but we talked
all night. Just about everything. The night sky. The
cattails growing on the road. How much we hated
horse apples—

ROSE
(as if trying to finish story) Goodnight, dreamer...
(beat) Goodbye.

EDWINA
(staring at ROSE) When I woke up midday all my
things were gone. My money, my bags, my ticket
home: gone. Took me forever to get home, and even
longer to recover from my father’s wrath. (beat) If I
knew what I know now, would I have let that boy
sleep in my room again? (beat; holding back) Yes...

EDWINA rises from the chair.
