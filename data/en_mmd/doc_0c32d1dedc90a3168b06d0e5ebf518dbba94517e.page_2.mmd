‘The climate change scenarios were based on the Hadley Centre HadCM2 climate change
‘outputs for the 45 and 8.5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Based on the
scenario definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), RCP 45 is
described as an intermediate climate change scenario while RCP 8.5 is generally considered as

the basis for worst-case climate change scenario, The climate change analysis was conducted for

30 years’ time period based on recommendation from the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO, 2017). The historical climate spans for the period 1989 to 2018 while the climate
change was studied for the near-term future of 2021-2050. The analysis of the climate data

bated on Hadley climate model for the 45 and 8.5 RCPs showed that the monthly precipitation

may decrease while the average monthly temperature may increase inthe coming three
decades (Figure 2). The long-term average annual precipitation for the historical climate (1989-

2020), near-term future climate scenarios based on 4.5 RCP, and 8.5 RCP may be 793 mm, 743,

mm and 656 mm, respectively,
