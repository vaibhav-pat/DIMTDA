Appendix H: Occiput Posterior Position

At onset of labor 15-30% of fetuses are occiput posterior (OP) in relation to the.
maternal pelvis, and 1/3 are OP sometime during labor. Most OP fetuses rotate on their
‘own, leaving only 3-8% being OP at birth. On the whole, OP position is underdiagnosed.
Identifying persistently OP fetuses is important because the position is associated with:

© Increase in prolonged pregnancy (12% v 7% p<.001)
‘oxytocin induction (81% v 16% p<.001) and oxytocin augmentation (52% v
32% p<.001)
Prolonged labor lasting more than 12 hours (12% v 1.7% p<.001)
Increase in operative vaginal birth (84% v 40% p<.001)""
