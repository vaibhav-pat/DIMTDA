Characteristics are called natural if they are constructed for the nominal values of volt-
age and magnetic flux, and also in the absence of additional resistances in the armature,
circuit. If each of these conditions is violated, the characteristic is considered to be artificial

‘The type of speed characteri

depends on the circuit of the excitation winding. Let
us construct the speed characteristics m = flla), where /. is the anchor current, which deter~
‘mines the load value.
1) Motors with independent excitation have a fairly rigid characteristic (Fig. 5.13).
When the load increases, its speed decreases a little, only because of the voltage drop
in the elements of the electrical circuit. With this

cheme, itis possible to regulate the current

in the excitation winding so that the value of the main-pole current is constant ( = const)

and does not change due to the demagnetizing effect of the anchor reaction flux.

Figure 5.13 ~ Speed characteristic of a DC motor
1 for a motor with independent excitation; 2 — for a motor with parallel excitation:
3 for the engine with mixed excitation; 4 ~ for a series-excited motor

Such excitement is used for the most powerful machines. There are large currents and
voltages in the anchor winding of the machines of high power. Therefore, the regulation of
the engine speed and reverse is performed along the excitation winding circuit. In the exci-
tation winding circuit, the current and voltage are less. Therefore, the control can be per
formed along the excitation winding circuit,

2) For engines with parallel excitation (line 2) the speed of the anchor is first reduced
because of the voltage drop in the elements of the electrical circuit. Then the demagnetizing
effect of the anchor reaction flow begins to act. The speed of the anchor decreases less. And
from some point it even begins to increase.
