c Glory to you, O Lord
"For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning
to hire laborers for his vineyard. *After agreeing with the laborers for the usual
daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard. "When he went out about nine o'clock,
he saw others standing idle in the marketplace; “and he said to them, "You also go,
into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’ So they went. “When he
went out again about noon and about three o'clock, he did the same. °And about
five o'clock he went out and found others standing around; and he said to them,
"Why are you standing here idle all day’” "They said to him, ‘Because no one has
hired us.’ He said to them, "You also go into the vineyard.’ *When evening came,
the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and give them
their pay, beginning with the last and then going to the first. °When those hired
about five o'clock came, each of them received the usual daily wage. !"Now when
the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also
received the usual daily wage. ''And when they received it, they grumbled against,
the landowner, “saying, "These last worked only one hour, and you have made
them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching,

heat.’ "But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you
not agree with me for the usual daily wage? ‘Take what belongs to you and go; I
choose to give to this last the same as I give to you. “Am I not allowed to do what,
I choose with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous
