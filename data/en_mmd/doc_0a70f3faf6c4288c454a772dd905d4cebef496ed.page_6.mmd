2.3. Practical tools for the combined evaluation

‘A good judgment requires having the right distance and looking from different
perspectives (triangulation).

In order to provide a thorough evaluation, we will use three basic tools:

1) Surveys ~ for analyzing reactions of participants, their self-assessment of
progress made, perceived usefulness of learning outcomes (etc).

2) Interviews ~ for analyzing the results and changes in behavior. Among others,
we will ask about the observations and level of satisfaction of employers and
participants.

8) Assessment of learning outcomes — for analyzing if learners have mastered
the knowledge, skills and competences and, to some extent, also the
effectiveness of training, This tool refers to the examinations (and other
methods) used by partners in experimentation phase.

‘Common terminology and guidelines for choice of assessment methods are presented
in part 3 of this document,

‘The planned surveys and interviews are presented in part 4. The surveys are
presented in Annexes.

Note: These tools will be used for combined evaluation of learning outcomes. But at
the same time, one of the aims of the project is improving and experimenting with
assessment methods of learning outcomes. This will require critical reflection on the
assessments conducted by partners, for example on the: organization, methods and
results of assessment of learning outcomes for analyzing the improvement of skils,
training quality, accuracy of assessment methods.
