MY SPOUSE HAD AN AFFAIR — WILL THE COURT TAKE
THIS IN ACCOUNT?

Responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage is not relevant. Divorce is
based on a ‘no fault’ principle.

However, in any divorce application, the Court must take many matters into
account.

One of the things it will look at is conduct of the parties 'where that conduct is,
such that in the opinion of the Court it would in all the circumstances of the case
be unjust to disregard it.

‘ACourt will not, however, take conduct into account unless itis ‘gross and

obvious’.

This will rule out conduct as a significant factor in most family law cases.

WHAT WILL THE COURT DO WITH THE FAMILY HOME? -
I WANT TO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN IT.
‘The Family Home features in almost every application for Divorce/Judicial
Separation.
‘The Court must ensure that both parties’ accommodation needs are met and in
order to do so can make these property orders:
> The Court may direct that property be transferred from one spouse to
another, or to any dependent family member, or to a specified person
for the benefit of such a member.
> The Court can direct that one party live in the property for a certain
period of time or for their life or until the youngest children reaches a
certain age
> The Court can order the sale of the house and the division of the net
proceeds of sale in certain proportions.
