DECLARATORY RELIEF

‘A-court may, in its discretion, grant a declaration where it has jurisdiction to hear
the issue, where the dispute is real and not theoretical, where the party raising the
issue has a genuine interest in its resolution, and where the respondent has an
interest in opposing the declaration sought. A declaration is an exceptional and
discretionary remedy that should normally be declined where there exists an
adequate alternative statutory mechanism to resolve the dispute or to protect the
rights in question: Ewert v Canada, 2018 SCC 30 at paras 81, 83

DIRECTED VERDICTS

When counsel for an accused applies for a directed verdict at the end of the
Crown's case, the trial judge must decide whether there is some evidence on the
basis of which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could return a verdict of guilty
{or the offence in question: A v Al-Enzi, 2021 ONCA 81, at para 148

‘The test on a directed verdict application is the same as on a preliminary inquiry:
Rv Pannu, 2015 ONCA 677 at para 158

For a trial judge to make this finding, the Crown must adduce evidence on every
‘essential element of the offence for which the Grown has the evidential
burden: Hayes, at para. 65; Tomlinson, at para. 151. If the Crown's case is
circumstantial, as was the case here, the trial judge must engage in a limited
weighing of the evidence to determine whether it is “reasonably capable of
‘supporting the inferences the Crown seeks to have the jury draw: Rv Al-Enzi, 2021
ONCA 81, at para 149

A trial judge's directed verdict decision is a question of law which does not
‘command appellate deference: A v Anderson, 2018 ONCA 1002, at para 19
