nimal’s current heading direction, and its self-generated movement (Etienne & Jeffery, 2004;

Miller & Wehner, 1988).

‘We speculate that a mechanism of path integration operates in skin space (Fig. 2)

beginning, just as the homing animal does. The problem is that other mechanisms can also

calculate the homing path. For example, the animal could transform the start and end

locations into egocentric external coordinates. It could thet

from the end location to the start locati

and tace the direct line of the homing path
Interestingly, however, animals that perform path integration generally show a characteristic
error the homeward path shows a slight understeer, or bis towards the outward path, The
reasons for this error ae disputed. On one view, it results from a weighted averaging of the

ditect

information on the outward path (Miller & Webs

, 1988). On another view, itis a

strategic adaptation that minimises the tisk of missing the home location. Understeer ensures

that the animal crosses its outward path on the return journey, at which point it can benefit

from memory cues to ensure the final approach (Etienne & Jeffery, 2004). In any ease, the

understeer error is considered a

ersal feature of animal navigation, since itis shown by

dogs, humans, rodents and insects (Fig. 3),

We therefore invest

xed whether perception of tactile spatial pattems on the human

skin involved the systematic bias towards the outward path that characterises understeer
