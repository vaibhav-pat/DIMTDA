FIRST SCRIPTURE LESSON Psalm 95
* 0 come, let us sing to the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the rock
of our salvation! ? Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let
us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise! ? For the Lord is a
great God, and a great King above all gods. * In his hand are the depths
of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also. ° The sea is his,
for he made it, and the dry land, which his hands have formed.
