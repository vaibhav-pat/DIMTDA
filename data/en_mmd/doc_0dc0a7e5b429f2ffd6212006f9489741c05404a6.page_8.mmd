Day Four

1, Included in your notes for this week, I gave you a chart of The Seven Churches of Revelation,
Chapters 2&3. Today, your task isto fill in the top row for the church at Ephesus.

Using only the text of Revelation 2:1-7, fll in the chart (using bullet point remarks) - this will
tive you a good summary of Chris's message to this church. For example: under CHRIST.
record how Jesus is described in these verses; under COMMENDATION, record the positive
things He says about this church; under CONCERN, state the Lord’s concern (what they have
done of are doing wrong); under COMMAND OR CONSEQUENCE, record Jesus" instru

to the church and what will happen if they fail to obey: and under COUNSEL & COMFORT,
‘note how the Lord concludes His message to the church (see verse 7)

Day Five

1. Using information from yous Interpretation Worksheet for Revelation 2:1-7, go back through
this message to the church in Ephesus and record the positive aspects (Commendations) Jesus
said were true of these believers. Think and pray through how these things apply to you. Ate
these things true of you? Are you working hard in the Kingdom and persevering in faith, even
under trials? Do you hate evil? Is it tue that you cannot (and do not) tolerate those who teach
error or lead others into sin? Have you left your fist love (your priority love of Christ and His
‘ruth!)? Pray about these things and make some specifie plans to grow and change (record these
‘on the Application Worksheet)

2. Pray for Valley Heights ~ that we, as a church, would never leave our fist love, but grow
‘our affection for Jesus Christ our Lord and love for His truth (above all other loves!). Blessings!
