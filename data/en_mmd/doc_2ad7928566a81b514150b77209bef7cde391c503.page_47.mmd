(4) Social and emotional wellbeing and mental health

‘The Campaign Steering Committee also notes the recurrent theme of social and
‘emotional wellbeing and mental health continuing to be highlighted by services,
evaluation and policy reviewers as a significant service gap. We note the
recommendations contained within the 2015 Mental Health Commissions Report
Contributing Lives, Thriving Communities ~ Review of Mental Health Programmes
and Services, 2015. The Report highlighted that there is a significant mental health
‘gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous
people, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people more likely to experience
psychological distress, hospitalisation for mental illnesses and death from intentional
self-harm. Despite having greater needs, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
‘experience lower access to mental health services than the rest of the population.

‘The Campaign Steering Committee supports the Mental Health Commission's
recommendations:

» Recommendation 5 ~ Make Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental
health a national priority and agree an additional COAG Closing the Gap
target specifically for mental health.

+ Recommendation 18 ~ Establish mental health and social and emotional
wellbeing teams in Indigenous Primary Health Care Organisations (including
Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services), linked to Aboriginal and
Torres Strat Islander specialist mental health services.
