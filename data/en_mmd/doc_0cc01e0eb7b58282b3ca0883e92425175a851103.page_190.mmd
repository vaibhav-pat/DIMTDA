TENNESSEE
A role? Spoiled booze? What did you need?
GARBO

I wanted to say hello... It’s all right. You never were
very good with people.

TENNESSEE
This is an absolute lic. I’m practically a savant.

GARBO
You're fantastic with... celebrities. Not people.

TENNESSEE
(remembering) This is where we have that
conversation; I really need to stop with these.

GARBO
You do. Switch. (replacing his bottle with her milk)
Try this.
TENNESSEE

TENNESSEE
