Before Events and Services

Information Packet

+ Schedule of Events and Services Checklist: Provide a Schedule of
Events and Services checklist, and how they will be offered (in-person
location and/or online). Include start and end times so virtual
congregants can plan ahead, get logged on if accessing virtually, and
have everything they need readily available. People who use
transportation services need to arrange rides if attending in-person.

+ Inform people that your organization has a limited number of tablets
and/or laptops that can be checked out.

Creating and Sending Events and Services Information
Event and services information is often sent via email or e-newsletter
‘When creating and sending digital materials, here are some acce:
protocols to keep in mind:

+ When using graphics, include alternate text (also known as alt text or
image descriptions) to ensure accessibility for blind and low-vision
people using screen readers.

+ Alternate Text describes the purpose of the graphic, not just the
appearance. For example, write "a bar graph comparing ticket sales in
movie theaters across the United States over the past decade.” Do
not say “a graph,” as that does not convey the purpose of the graph.

+ Do not say “Image of.” Screen reader software will identify the image
as an image before reading the alternative text, so writing “image of”
is redundant.

+ Mention specific colors if they are pivotal to understanding the
image/graphic.

+ Share the emotions that the image is trying to evoke. Say “a funny
picture of a man fishing” versus “a man fishing,” for example.

+ Transcribe text if the image/graphic includes copy that is central to its
meaning.

+ Keep alternative text as concise as possible while including all
necessary information. Some screen readers cut off alternative text
