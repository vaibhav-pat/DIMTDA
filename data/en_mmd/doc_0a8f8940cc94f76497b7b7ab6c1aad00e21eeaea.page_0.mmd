The Cage

GEG
GAG You've got | love yous

‘built a cage ‘Strung together lke rope

(One bar at atime Think | cant feel them

And \ lacked myself ‘Around my throat

Inside The blindfold’s on,

{played the foo! Butstil|see

dida’t mean to be so cruel You're not who I love

That 'é hurt you You're not what | need (repeat)
like I do

266 GEC

When I'm folded here alone and afraid ve got to make a change

| gotta be brave fm breaking out ofthe cage
"gotta stand up ‘cause it's time to make a change

Baby, it’s time to make a change

C0/6,6,C
‘Cause now I'm living without you

And it's wrong, baby

it's time to break away

‘oh now, I'm breathing without you

and 'l never be the same

0,6,F,¢

It's time to be brave / I's time to make a change

GAGE
You took the layers off
One piece at atime

And you stared

At my insides

{And now I'm standing here
Tired and criticized

So, | gotta tell you

That it's time

PRE-CHORUS / CHORUS

Vamp on 6, F,¢
It's time to make a change (big)
