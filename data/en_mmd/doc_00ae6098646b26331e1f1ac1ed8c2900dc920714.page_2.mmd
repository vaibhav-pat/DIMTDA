cenergy.** Scher and colleagues have demonstrated a decrease in a pitcher's
‘nondominant hip may increase the demands of the decelerating the body from the hip to the

shoulder? Under these circumstances, there would be a reductio

in force through the larger
‘trunk musculature and an increase in force through the shoulder, potentially increasing the tsk
for shoulder injuy.? Similarly, overhead throwers tend to compensate for a decrease in dominant
hip extension by increasing dominant shoulder external rotation in order to generate high ball

Velocities or throw long distances. This compensation for restricted hip flexibility can increase

soft tissue forces and loading at the shoulder and/or elbow.? This demonstrates the relationship
‘and interaction present between hip and shoulder function during overhead activity. Clinicians

and should use this information to design sport-specific conditioning programs for their
athletes. Exercises to improve hip Mlexibility as well as strength ofthe dominant hip flexors and
extensors and nondominant hip external and internal rotator should be incorporated into an
‘overhead athletes regimen to potentially prevent injury and enhance performance?

Kinetic Chain Clinical Relevance to Overhead Athletes:

‘A better understanding of kinetie chain mechanics and their association to force and load

‘throughout the musculoskeletal tissue ean allow health professionals deisgn more effective

ny
prevention, treatment and rehab programs and perhaps improve performance as well*

‘Additional research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of exercises and theory surrounding

training and c

iioning in the context of the Kinetic chain with regard 10 performance

jury prevention, These results can demonstrate that rehabilitation efforts for

shoulder andior upper extremity injury need to &

sentrate on allowing functional return of the

shoulder joint inthe context ofthe entire

netic chain, including the all-important hip joints, for

‘overhead athletic participation. Additionally, clinical evaluation of the shoulder could be
