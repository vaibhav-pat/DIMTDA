Dr. Bartlett and Dr. Hubert have come under considerable controversy
over the Peak Oil theory. The gainsayers generally follow along some
line of declaration over how much undiscovered oil remains in the
ground. These charts report the data taken from the United States
Geological Survey as of its 2011 study.” Other information was drawn
from a United States Department of Interior report. One must be very
careful when handling this data. The units can be very confusing. When
production is reported in units per day, we must insist that someone is,
deliberately distorting the data to make production seem smaller than it
really is. The USGS report gives several figures, the most representative
of which appears to be around 1,614 to 1,666 billion barrels worldwide.
We will show more data in the United States specific chart, for you to
get the idea. This number is actually smaller than Dr. Bartlett’s estimate
of 2,000 billion barrels. There is no significant reason to doubt Dr.
Bartlett’s estimate that the world oil peak came at 2004, and the world
will run out of oil around the year 2100. Dr. Bartlett’s 3,000 billion
