Warming will probably stop all by itself. We will be more concerned
with freezing and starvation. On the other hand, if massive new
discoveries of gas and oil become a reality, Global Warming could
prove to be a considerable danger; because man, given the opportunity,
will only increase consumption, with its attendant escalation of waste
heat.

Equations
‘The basic exponential equation:

yQ=a*h
Where a, is the value of yo, the intercept where y (t) crosses the y axi
the initial value when the horizontal, or x value is zero; b is the

exponential constant; and ¢ is the time, distance, or other factor plotted
on the horizontal, or x axis. If ris the rate of growth:

b=l+r
1, or 100% ordinary steady growth:

Doubling

If we begin with an initial value of a, and a final value of 2a, we find the
doubling time:

yQ=ato
2a = a* bt: dividing both sides by a
2=b

In (2) = In (b') =¢* In (b)
t (doubling time) = In (2) /In (b)
0.693 / (r /) or (69.3%) I (1% / 1) or (70%) | (r% / t)

In developing the rule-of-thumb approximation, we make note of the
fact that for r values of 10% or less, the In (1 +r) © r, and 69.3% = 70%.
The following chart compares exact and rule-of-thumb calculations.
‘These estimates are very good and usually err on the safe side.
