CAPOTE
It doesn’t deserve one.

WARHOL
So. Tennessee, you write plays? That’s riveting.

CAPOTE
We don’t need to hear about that. We need to hear
about this novel I’m almost done writing—novella.
Novella and three short stories. It’s about a prostitute
who doesn’t have sex with the men—maybe—they
call these girls “call girls”—and that’s how I know its
going to make a dapper film as soon as it’s
published—and the woman, this woman’s name is
Holly—I’ll tell you who’s playing her, fantastic
actress if I get my way: Monroe. Have you met her?

WARHOL
Tell me about your Sweet Bird of Youth. Right?
That’s such a nice name.

TENNESSEE
How ‘bout I don’t talk to you. (no response) We just
sit here and don’t go past this point and (to FRANK)
why aren’t you holding my hand back? Or did I not
even grab yours that night? ‘Cause that blond kept
looking at me with his hungry eyes. (no response)
Did you even once look at me that night? Or were
you drooling at meeting another star...
