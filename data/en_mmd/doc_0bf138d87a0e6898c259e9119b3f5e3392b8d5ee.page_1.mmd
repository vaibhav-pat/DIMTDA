workshops. Highlights from the discussion are noted below.

Practices around seclusion are the focus of several health and disability sector
organisations, in particular the work of the Health Quality & Safety Commission
(HOSC) and Te Pou. The standards surrounding seclusions will need to be able to
adapt to such a changing landscape. New Safe Practice Effective (SPEC) training
in the DHBs was discussed, particularly surrounding involvement of Consumer
‘Advisor employees. An update will be provided at the next meeting

Itwas asked whether Te Tiriti would be used as opposed to the Treaty.
HealthCERT will seek advice from the Maori Health Directorate within the Ministry
of Health. The timeline of WAl 2575 treaty claim and its potential implications for
this review was also discussed.

Standards relating to organisational management must consider cultural safety in
terms of ethnicity and in terms of organisation culture. The way Oranga Tamariki's
standards interface with the Minitry’s was asked to be considered.
