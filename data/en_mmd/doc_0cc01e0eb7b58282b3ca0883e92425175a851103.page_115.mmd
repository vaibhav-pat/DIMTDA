TENNESSEE
Yes. I’d love to talk to you, yes.

GARBO
(window area) Up here?
TENNESSEE
Wait—!
GARBO

What, are we afraid of heights all of a sudden?

GARBO goes to the window and opens it,
putting her back to it and enjoying the
breeze. She’s in her twenties and looks
around the room with a similar absorption
as FRANK, but with much more desperation:
every room she’s in is her last ever.

GARBO
You remember the first time we met?

TENNESSEE
You ignored me on the street.

GARBO
I don’t recall that. Well, I’m sorry.

TENNESSEE
You wouldn’t do a... a play I wrote.
