Chemical Problem soils
Lecture 8. Salt — affected soils
‘The salt-affected soils occur in the arid and semiarid regions
where evapo-transpiration greatly exceeds precipitation. The accumulated
ions causing salinity or alkalinity include sodium, potassium, magnesium,
calcium, chlorides, carbonates and bicarbonates. The salt- affected soils
‘ean be primatily classified as saline soil and sodie soil, The state-wise
distribution of salt affected soils in India is presented in the following

Saline soils defined as soils having a conductivity of the
saturation extract greater than 4 dS my" and an exchangeable sodium
percentage less than 15 Saline soils defined as soils having a conductivity
of the saturation extract greater than 4 dS m' and an exchangeable
sodium percentage less than 15. The pH is usualy les than 8.5. Formerly
these soils were called white alkali soils because of surface crust of white

salts,
