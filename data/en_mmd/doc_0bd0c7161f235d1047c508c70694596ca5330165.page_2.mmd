A. Introduction

‘The interest in secondary Li/O: batteries has grown rapidly over the past two decades, as they
exhibit a practically achievable specific energy of about 1,700 Wivkg, which equals that of

‘gasoline and is well beyond those of conventional battery systems [1,2],

‘The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) isthe

Luoite et al, to take place in non-aqueous electrolytes [3.4]

During discharge a one-electron reduetion of oxygen to superoxide LiO2 (eq. 1) is followed by

‘4 further one-electron reduction and/or a chemical di

roportionation of LiOs to lithium

peroxide LisOs (eqs. 2 and 3) [5-7]. This mechanism was confirmed by in sitw-spectroscopic

studies revealing LiO: as ORR intermediate as well as its subsequent chemical

isproportionation Li: (eg, 3) [8]. A further two-electron reduction of LisOs takes place at
lower potentials and results in the formation of lithium oxide Li (eq, 4) [9]. Discharge to
LLisO would increase the theoretical specific energy of the aprotic Lifair system by about 800

‘Whikg [10]. However,

is electrochemically irreversible and hence can only be oxidized

at large overpotentials, so that LisO: (with a reversible redox potential of £° = 2.96 V [11,12))

is the desited discharge product [4,13].
