All electrochemical measurements were carried out at ambient temperature with a Reference

£600 potentiostat (Gamry Instruments) and 2 VMP-300 multipotentiostat (Bio-Logic Science
Instruments), Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carsied out in Ar atmosphere with a sea
tate of in a potential range of AE = 2.0 V ~ 4.5 V vs, LifLi'. For all other electrochemical

the test cells were purged with a constant Os gas flow of 4 mL/min ata pressure

(of 3 bar (gas purity: 5.0, AGA. AS). Galv:

static eye

ig and cyclic voltammetry (CV)

experiments were performed with a discharge/charge current density of = 75 mA ge“ and a

potential scan rate of|

0.1 mV s+, respectively, ina potential window of AE =2.0 V4.5

V vs. LifL.*. Differential capacity plots were obtained from galvanostaic ey

experiments

‘with a resolution of AE =0.1 mV.

All electrochemical measurements were carried out at least three times 1 check for

reproducibility. Average values a

standard deviations are displayed in the respective Figures

unless otherwise noted.

cterization methods

‘Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using a FEI Helios G4 UX dual-beam

focused ion beam ~ scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) with an acceleration voltage of
15 kV. GDE cross-sections were made in situ inside the FIB with the Ga" ion beam. Prior to

making a cross-seetion, carbon proteetion layers (frst, a thi

layer deposited with electron

beam-assisted deposition a

I, second, a thicker layer depos beam-assisted

ted by io

deposition) were deposited on the surface of the region of interest.
