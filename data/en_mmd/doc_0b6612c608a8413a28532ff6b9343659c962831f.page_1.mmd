EVALUATION DAY:

Evaluations will be held on Saturday, December 3° between 9am & 12pm.
© Stop by anytime during these hours for your 20 minute evaluation.
Evaluations are important - please make every effort to attend. This allows us to
fairly distribute skills and abilities among all teams.

make alternate arrangements. jake.bunjo@lansnaz.com
During evaluation time, parents will determine sizing for their child’s uniform,

league.
