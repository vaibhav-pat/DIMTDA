Week beginning 15.6.20 Science Activity

1) Make a paper aeroplane

2) Decorate it so it looks like a real aeroplane, Maybe you might
use an army pattern like a wartime plane, or you might prefer
to make a plane like one that takes you on holiday with lots of
little window holes.

3) Experiment with seeing how far it will fly.

4) Try adding weight (using sellotape, bluetack or a paper clip) to
different parts of the plane. How does it affect the flight?

5) Fill in you notes on a table like this: If you don't have a ruler to
measure distances, then use big strides which are about 50cm
in length.
