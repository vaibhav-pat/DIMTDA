Synchronous generator can be loaded slowly or quickly.

With a slow increase in load, statie stability is established, with a fast set dynamic
stability. Static stability characterizes the ability of the generator to work stably with a
slowly changing load.

Dynamic stability characterizes the generator’s ability to work stably under rapidly
changing loads

Rotor swing

aaa If the load angle increases due to a change

kW in the magnitude and nature of the load, the

power value is not set to the desired value. And
there is an increase, then a decrease. The rotor
swings relative to the desired value, fig. 4.21

If you do not reduce these swings, then the
synchronous mode will break. The connection
between the rotor and the stator field can break,
‘The rotational speed of the rotor and turbine will
begin to increase. They can collapse. This is an

4.21 ~ The rocking of the synchronous,
generator accident.
Itis necessary to take measures to calm the
fluctuations. To do this, generators make a damper winding. This winding is placed in the
slots, which are made in the tips of the poles of the rotor.
‘The damper winding in turbogenerators is placed at the bottom of the rotor slots.

Parallel operation of synchronous generators

In power stations and industrial plants, several generators often work in parallel, on the

same Power Grid
