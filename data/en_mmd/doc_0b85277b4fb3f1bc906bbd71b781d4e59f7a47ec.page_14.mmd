Graph 9: Differences in 20-Metre Sprint Time For Each Subject During all Three Tests.

subject

Graph 9 shows the relative trend of each test for each product during the sprint test over
20-metres. Increased performance is indicated by a decreased time on the test in
seconds. Both the Trusox and Modified Trusox show relative decreased times in
‘comparison to the Football Sock, when performed by the same subjects. The graph
‘also shows that in general all three products followed a similar relative trend of
performance across all esting, albeit at greater degrees of ability. For instance subject
7 showed a greater score on all esting for all products and subject 6 showed a
decreased score for all tests compared to all subjects. This would suggest the Trusox
works by enhancing the subjects own potential, when compared to football socks in all
the majority of the testing,
