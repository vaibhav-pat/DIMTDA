Some studies apply apportionment of interference criteria between 5G and other services up 10
4.7 dB which causes up to 4.74B reduction for maximum transmitter power

For non-baseline cases, several studies have been conducted with different assumptions from
â€˜TGS/1, ie. 5 dB higher antenna element conducted power or 16x16 array antenna elements for
beamforming (TGS/L uses 8x8 16x16 array antenna elements for beamforming). With that, those
studies provide that the interference Would be increased up to 5 dB or up to 3 dB respectively
Other several studies consider assumptions with more overloading IMT deployment by

increasing density of BS, BS network loading and no clutter, additionally. And then interference
UN would be as high as -15 to -7.6 dB, which corresponds to maximum transmitter power level
(of 28 0 23.4 dBm/200MHz
