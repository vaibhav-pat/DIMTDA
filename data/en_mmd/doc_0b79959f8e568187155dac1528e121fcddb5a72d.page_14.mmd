Furthermore, what we offered above can be seen as a response to Strawson on sensory

fields: there is a clear sense of a tactile field that is sustained by skin-space. In particular,

tactile RFs form the ‘parts’ of an extended sensory field. Not

nly do these parts have

specif

spatial relations to one another as a matter of anatomical fact, but the natural

statistics of typical motions across the field allow these spatial relatio

to be leamed, and
exploited for spatial perception. Thus, postulating a tactile field not only helps in explaining

relevant behavioural d

but also has a plausible physiological underpinning.

Now finally, we would like fo say a bit more about the explanatory value of our

‘concept ofa tactile field defi

(Macpherson 2011). Within the somatosensory system, researchers distinguish between the
nociceptive system, the thermal system, and the tactile system. In this work we have shown
that we need to postulate a sensory field inthe tactile case. However, other studies suggest
