Grade 6-8 Guidelines

* _ fter receiving initial notice from the Head of School about school closure and
timelines, families will receive an email from the grade 6-8 Principal with division-
specific information

"The primary tools for communication between teachers and families will be
‘GMail and PowerSchool

* Teachers will either link materials linked in PowerSchool class pages or share
materials directly to each student's Google Classroom

+ Distance learning for our early adolescent leamers will focus on having a
balanced, holistic learning experience. Students will have both off- and on-screen
learning activities designed to engage the middle school learner

* Learning experiences are designed to be completed independently or in
collaboration with other students. Tutoring is not recommended, nor should a
parent/guardian be too involved.
