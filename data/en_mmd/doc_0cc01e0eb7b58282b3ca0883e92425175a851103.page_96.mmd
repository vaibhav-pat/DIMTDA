TENN crumples up the paper and throws it
in another drawer. He gets the correct sides.

TENNESSEE
Oh my, well I guess this read’s gonna just smart, isn’t
it? You look nothing like Stanley Kowalski! He was
a middle-aged man, you know.

BRANDO.
Well, I’m not too sure about this part either! I figure
I'ma pretty decent guy and this is just... a harsh guy.

TENNESSEE
Then I guess that’s that! Good day to you, Starkist!
(throwing the sides back ina drawer) Oh, all right! If
you insist! (pulling out sides) But only because
Gadg—Wait, this is Menagerie again. Who put
Menagerie in here? Hey, who put...? (after reading
some) Laurette Taylor read off these sides...

EDWINA
(after BRANDO doesn’t respond) Eh-hem.

TENNESSEE
Right, uh. I just—hold on. Laurette Taylor read off
these sides... I wanted Greta Garbo, but she denied
me flatly.

EDWINA
Finish the Brando memory!
