BURDEN OF PROOF

A. REASONABLE DOUBT

‘The standard of "reasonable doubt" does not apply when a judge is dealing with
individual items of evidence and not the ultimate question of whether guilt was
proved: Rv Maclsaac, 2017 ONCA 172 at para 72

surrounding the W(D) analysis, see Evidence Law, Witnesses

‘Areasonable doubt need not arise from the evidence. Itcan arise from the absence
of evidence, from what the Crown has failed to prove.

Moreover, an inference need not arise from proven facts. This is because a
reference to "proven facts" suggests an obligation to establish those facts to a
standard of proof, yet a reasonable doubt can arise from evidence that, while not
proven to be true to any standard of proof, has nat been rejected.

Itis also incorrect to link a reasonable doubt to a “conclusion” drawn from the facts.
‘An acquittal need not be based on a conclusion about innocence but can rest on
an inability to conclude guilt.

It is also an error to suggest that an exculpatory inference must be “a much
stronger conclusion” than a speculation or guess. That language imports the need
for a strong inference, when an exculpatory inference relating to a required
‘element of the offence need merely raise a reasonable doubt: A v Darnley, 2020
ONCA 179, at paras 33-38

For an example of the difference between speculation on uncalled evidence, and
considering gaps in the evidence when determining whether the case has been
proved beyond a reasonable doubt, see Rv MacKenzie, 2020 ONCA 646, at paras
48-60

In Carbone, the Court of Appeal found that the repeated use of the words “convince”
and “persuade" in reference to the defence evidence suggested that the trial judge
looked to the defence to satisfy him that he should not accept the complainant's
version of events. This was found to constitute a reversal of the burden of proof:
