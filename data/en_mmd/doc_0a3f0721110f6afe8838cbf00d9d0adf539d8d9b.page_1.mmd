+ As|go from activity to activity, | will wash my hands. When I go to the
restroom, | will inform my counselor so that she may wipe the area
down with Lysol or Bleach for my safety and for the safety of others

+ If Hee! hot or tired, | will tell one of my counselors who will take me to
the office to rest in the air-conditioning. | will not touch anything in the
office because | do not know who has touched those things. My
counselor will wipe the leather sofa down with Bleach or Lysol before
and after.

+ Although other campers’ horses are cute and | want to pet them and
kiss them and give them treats, | will save all petting and kissing and
treats for my special horse. My special horse will be mine all week!

‘+ Lwill be doing many fun things at camp (including a scavenger hunt,
Pony Yoga, painting, and possibly archery and fishing) in addition to
the time | spend with my special horse! Each of these activities
means that | need to review the rules of social distancing often so
that | do not forget because | am having so much fun. | will not
‘complain to my counselor when she reminds me of the rules; |
understand that by following these rules, | will be able to have the
best time ever at camp!!
