Hume calls attention to this fact in a passage where he
discusses the passion of gaming. He depicts this passion as the interaction of two
<ualitatively different substances, and he explicitly compares it to chemical preparations:

“as in certain chemical preparations, where the mixture of two cleat and transparent liquids

produces a third, which is opaque and colour'd” (T 23.10.9). In the following, Hume

appeals to the phenomenon 1

most occupies Newton in the Opticks: the colors of light
fevealed through the prism and he compares the phenomenon with the passions.

‘Are not these as plain proofs, that the passions of fear and hope are mistures

of grief and joy, a8 in optics “tis @ proof, that a colour'd ray of the sun

‘passing thro” a prism, is a composition of two others, when, as you diminish

‘or enctease the quantity of either, you find it prevail proportionably more

admits of stronger proofs. (T2.3.9.19)

What are we to make of Hume's appeal to chemistry in his discussion of the

passions? In his recent book, Tansis Demeter addresses this question by

ting

Hume's use of chemical language to an

jguing and illuminating history of scientific

developments, the most important of which is the emergence of the science of chemistry
