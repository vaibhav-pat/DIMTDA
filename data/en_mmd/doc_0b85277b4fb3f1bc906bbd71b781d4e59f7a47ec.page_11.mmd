Graph 6: Trusox total percentage improvement compared to Football socks.

Graph 6 shows the total cumulative percentage improvement increase across the two
‘groups. The average percentage improvement for a single trial compared to Football
socks in group 1 is 14.39% and group 2 11.2%.

Graph 5 and 6, demonstrate that individuals who have the ability to perform agilty
movements in a more explosive fashion, may actually show a greater level of
percentage improvement in Trusox compared to Football Socks. Whilst all subjects
showed a percentage increase in performance with the Trusox compared to the Football
‘sock, itis likely faster more mobile subjects show the greatest performance increase.

Given elite athletes are considered to perform such agility movements with more
efficiency than non-professional subjects its feasible to suggest such athletes would
gain the greatest degree of improvement from the Trusox and perhaps explains the
large uptake within the English Premier League.
