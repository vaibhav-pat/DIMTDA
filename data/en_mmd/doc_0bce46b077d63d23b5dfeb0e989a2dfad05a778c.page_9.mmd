you know Patrick Stewart having to have a toupee “Jarrah laughs in the test shots and al, that
but thats a litle diferent.

JARRAH:
‘Yeah. There's kind of two parts in this documentary where they talk significantly about race.
‘There's this beginning part of Avery Brooks's appearance where they have the Paramount
former exec Kerry McCluggage who seems kind of, he's it anything ike the most kind of! guess
antagonistic to Ira. In that like lra's calling him out on things he didnt agree with atthe time, alot
more, And lke “why did-

GRACE:
‘Also he is just dressed lke a cartoon caricature ofa rich white guy.

ARRAN,
My God! The ike cardigan sweater over tied around his neck? Yeah. Very much.

SUE:
| mean you also get the impression that his opinions havent changed much,

JARRAH:
‘Yeah. He has this whole ke “We wouldn't want him to appear lke quote unquote street, or ike
for the lack ofa better word”

GRACE:
Find a better word is a better word!

SUE:
There's a better word!

JARRAH:
BBut then, the part at the beginning | felt like they do interview Penny Johnson who plays Kassidy
land they have abit of her opinion but itis mostly just ike “I thought it was really sexy without his
hai.” And partly because Avery didn't do new interviews for this movie, that part like fees alitle
bit lke tted towards interviewing white people about Avery Brooks's appearance. But the
‘second part later where it's taking about him as ike “A strong black father igure who's a
positive figure for Jake” that | thought was pretty well done with Citroc Lofton, and it was just lke
a really nice part of the documentary.

GRACE:
| really appreciated Cirroc also drawing to attention the fact that this series was coming out and
they were having a black man be in charge ofthis sci setting inthis narrative utopia, you
know, so soon after the Rodney King riots. And how that brought into the fact that we've had 20,
years of social advancements since the show aired, But have we really?
