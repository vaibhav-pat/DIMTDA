Why didn’t RCEP conclude in full this year?

+ As reflocted in the Leaders Statement, one party, India, has a number of outstanding
issues that need to be resolved,

+ But | am pleased to confirm that Leaders of the 16 RCEP countries announced that
they would work with India to resolve its outstanding concerns in a way that would
Satisfy the interests ofall participants.

+ Leaders have allowed more time for negotiations to be completed and the agreement,
‘as a whole, o be concluded and signed in 2020. New Zealand is working intensively
with India to seek to agree a commercially meaningful market access deal by that
date.

How have New Zealanders been consulted?

+ The public was given the opportunity to make submissions on RCEP when negotiations first
began in 2013,

+ Since then there has been extensive outreach and engagement with stakeholders,
including many meetings with individual companies and other parts of civil society. This
has included dedicated engagement with Maori, and more recently through the
‘Government's Trade for All agenda,

‘Why have you not released the text?

+ The full negotiations have not yet been concluded.
+ AIL16 participants would need to agree to release the texts.

+ However, we recognise the importance of transparency to the New Zealand public
particularly around free trade negotiations.

+ We have also outined issues under negotiation at stakeholder and public meetings
throughout the negotiation process; we provided summaries from negotiation rounds and
‘other information on MFAT's website.
