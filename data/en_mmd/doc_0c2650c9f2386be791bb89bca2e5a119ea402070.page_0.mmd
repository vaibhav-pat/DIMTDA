Lesson Plan: Grade 8 Scien«

Inderstanding Systems in Mechanisms:
‘Systems in Action-Rube Goldberg

BIG IDEAS:

‘Whether large or small, hman, mechanical, or natural, systems consist of many components that

support a smooth functioning society. In this uit, students will explore, create and experiment with

a variety of systems to discover that systems are designed to accomplish tasks and that all systems,

Science and Technology Specific Curriculum Expectations:

2.)use technological problem-solving to investigate a system that performs a function ar meets a
need

2.6 use appropriate science and technology vocabulary, including mechanical advantage, input,
‘output, tition, gravity, forces, and efficiency, in oral and written communication

Leaming Goals: ‘Success Criter

‘We are learning the law of conservation of
energy by applying the rules of force, energy, and
simple machines tothe design and construction
of an effective and chain reaction system.

‘We will be successful when we design, build, and
present a Rube Goldberg system that has 7 steps.
Ie must incorporate a least 5 out of 6 simple
machines (whee! & axe, pulley, screw, inclined

plane, wedge, and lever)

lesson Overview:

{After exploring diferent simple machines, concepts of force, and work, students willbe given the
‘opportunity to construct @ Rube Goldberg project (chain reaction machine) that wll transfer energy
‘through a series of stations and ultimately complete a predetermined task.

‘Materials and Technology:
