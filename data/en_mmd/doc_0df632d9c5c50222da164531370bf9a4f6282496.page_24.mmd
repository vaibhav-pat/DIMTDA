In the chess board problem: we may number the squares from 1 to 64, or
from 0 to 63. Since the Exponential Function always starts at ¢= 0, we
prefer including the idea of zero. Here are the equations for calculating
the number of grains on any square, where b = 200% per square and
moving from square to square takes the place of time, and the doubling
time is 1 square:

y(=1*2=2
": numbering from zero; or 2"): numbering from one

y(n,

Geometric accumulation:

The chess board problem also considers accumulating the numbers as
we go along. This sum is known as a geometric series and sol
involves a mathematical trick. Here it is:

Dra tab + ab? + ab? +... + abl: multiplying by b
b* Sy =ab + ab? + ab? +... +ab! +ab

We notice that both equations are identical except for the first and the
last terms: so, subtracting the first equation from the second equation we
arrive at something we can always calculate quite easily.

b*®Y)-S) =a * bY —a: factoring

Zr *(b-1) =a * (bY — 1): dividing

Disa* (bY —1)/(b-1)
