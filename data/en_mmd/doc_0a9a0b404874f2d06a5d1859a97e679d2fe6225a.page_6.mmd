The Restoration in
2017.

Remarkably in the 130 years
since its installation, apart from
routine maintenance there has
been little major work required
which is a tribute to the quality
of the original workmanship.
At first the organ was powered
by a manually-operated
bellows worked from the side
byalever.

Meredith Archer, who served

as the organist for the next 60
years, was also the Headmaster
of Clive School so there would
presumably be no shortage of
conscripts to man the bellows
at Sunday services; and
therefore we can imagine the
collective sigh of relief when an
electric blower was installed in
1949.

The single area of concern had
been an earlier replacement of
the original pedalboard and
chest by an outside contractor
who opted to substitute the
existing tubular-pneumatic
action for an inferior solenoid
system which has now failed.
The restoration work has
ensured that a new Bourdon
chest unit, constructed to the
original Willis design, has been
installed to return to the
original pressurised chamber
featuring the more reliable
magnetic contacts.
