From Diagnostic Xray Soure

‘Suibmit the calculations for the dose received from diagnostic X-ray procedures. Inthe calculations you must
include the procedure name, (CT. radiograph, fluoroscopic, dental, et.) typeof procedures) (chest X-ray, whole
body CT, interventional cardiac Fluoroscopy, cc) the area of the body being imaged, andthe number of each
type of procedure being done inthe study. List ll radiation procedures inluding those clinically indicated and
those that would not be ceived unles the subject was incladed in this research study.

Each procedure must be itemized and categorized, ie. clinical v. research, so the Subcommittee can give full
consideration to the total radiation dose received by the subject. You must also provide the skin dose, bone
‘marrow dose, gonadal dose, other affected organ dose(s) nd the efective dose equivalent all stated in mSV) per
‘procedure. The individual performing the dose calculations and the dosimetry references used must be identified.

If you need assistance in completing the dose calculations, you may eal a medical physicist inthe University’s
Department of Radiology at 612-626-6638, You will be required to submit the same information requested inthe
first table below, so the medical physicist can most accurately caleulate the corresponding doses)
