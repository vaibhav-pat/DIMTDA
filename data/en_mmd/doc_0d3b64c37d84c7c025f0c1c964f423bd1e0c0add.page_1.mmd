flagged during following 15 weeks, and an endpoint was atthe transition from p, = 0.5 top, < OS.
Based on start and cad points of epidemics, the datasets were divided int epidemic’ and “nonspidemic’
psvods. The 1S.wock period of no start points before a stat pint and after an end was chosen so thatthe
gorithm would not flag epidemic ‘stars’ o ends’ during an ongoing outbreak, Choosing 15 wecks as
the interval tween two ‘stars will therefore miss an epidemic aly if the non-epidemic period between
‘wo outbreaks shorter than to weeks, When detecting spikes, the algorithms usualy flagged an
pidemic tart point, ut often no end point. nord tallow detection of spikes as single outbreak
‘wecks, an “end was inserted afer every “start” that was not followed byan “end within period of 30

weeks.
