2. Explain why the thermophiles don’t “mix” or “blend” if they can all live in the same hot spring.
Guide to Correct Response... Each species of thermophiles has its own temperature and pH range. While the pH of the
Grand Prismatic Hot Spring is about the same throughout, as the water spreads across this massive hot spring, it begins to
‘cool. Each thermophile has a particular temperature range that it best thrives in, which means that thermophiles seldom
“mis” or “blend” with oneanother.

Research Report to Dr. Burnap and Potential Responses

1. Provide an evidence-based explanation as to why the Grand Prismatic Hot Spring isso colorful
Guide to Correct Response... Grand Prismatic Hot Spring is colorful because of the thermophiles that live there.
Thermophiles are microbes which are very small, too small to see with the naked eye. But when they clump together they
form mats of color. Different species of thermophiles have their own optimal temperature range, and so will live inthe part
of the hot spring that supports this basic need. Each thermophile produces its own pigment and therefore produces their
‘own color. Grand Prismatic Hot Spring is so colorful because specific thermophiles, that contain specific pigments live in
specific temperature bands. Thus, each water temperature band results in a different band of color.

Dr. Burnap wants to learn about the mechanisms that different species of cyanobacteria use to obtain life sustaining
energy. Ifhe only has time to visit one hot spring, would you recommend that he visit the Grand Prismatic Hot
Spring? Provide evidence to support your claim,

Guide to Correct Response... YES ... Because due to the water gradient of the Grand Prismatic Hot Spring, multiple species
of Cyanobacteria thrive. The color of the organism matts and the temperature of the water could be used to identify the
species of Cyanobacteria
