losing Song: All Praise to Thee (with updated text in 2020)
In times of sickness, distancing and fear In homes, on screens
Your people cry out In church, in open air
‘To the God who's near Alleluia, Alleluia
Weeping or singing
We turn to find you here We pray in faith, disciples inthe world
Alleluia, Alleluia That Christ's life in ours
May somehow be unfurled
In scattered homes, Proclaiming His love
‘One body yet disbursed By sacrament and word
Watching and waiting Alleluia, Alleluia (continued next page)
‘As our sick are nursed ‘And as your saints
Holding our nation We give you thanks and praise
In our prayers immersed In song and silence
Alleluia, Alleluia To you our hearts we raise
Finding new ways to worship Father, Son, Spirit
And to care We worship you always
Binding together Alleluia, Alleluia

God's family everywhere

The Dismissal
Celebrant: Go forth into the world, rejoicing in the power of the Spirit.
Al: Thanks be to God. Amen.
