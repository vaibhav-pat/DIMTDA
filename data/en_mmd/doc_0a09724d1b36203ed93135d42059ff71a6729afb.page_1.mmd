The Department is promoting an incremental approach when implementing this
programme, not a wal-to-wall network approach. To date, 6 municipalities are
‘operating their pilot phases of Integrated Public Transport Networks and
planning expansion to other areas. These municipalities are the Cape Town,
Johannesburg, Tshwane, Ekurhuleni, George, and Nelson Mandela Bay.

The other 4 municipalities are at an advanced stage in launching their pilot
phases. These are Polokwane, Mangaung, Rustenburg and eThekwini. It should,
be noted that 3 municipalities were suspended from the programme for 3 years.
These are Msunduzi, Mbombela, and Buffalo City. The Department together with
National Treasury is finalising the readmission criteria for the suspended
‘municipalities.
