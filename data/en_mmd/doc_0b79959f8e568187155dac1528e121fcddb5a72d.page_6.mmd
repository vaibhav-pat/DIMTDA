conceptualise asthe squares ofa chessboard. Each mechanoreceptor projects via an afferent
‘neuron to the spinal cord, and thence via higher order projections neurons to the dorsal
column nuclei, thalamus, and somatosensory cortex (Mountcastle, 2005). Neutons at each
stage in the somatosensory pathway have a receptive field (RE). This term refers to the region

of

Jn fo which a neuron is responsive, in virtue of receiving afferent impulses from the

mechanoreceptor located there,

‘Our view of skin-space based on an inversion of Nicod’s argument is equivalent to
postulating a “tactile field” defined by the array of skin RFS. To quote Haggard and
Giovagnoli “ihe tactile field supports computation of spatial relations between individual

stimulus locations, and thus underlies tactile pattern perception,
