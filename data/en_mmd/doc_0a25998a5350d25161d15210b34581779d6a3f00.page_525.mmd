of W parties (Aj
azare located in different, separated

laboratories. Each party can perform operations and

obtain measurement outcomes. Contrary to the previous
case however, we do not consider here any particular
physical description of what happens in each lab;

the “settings” for the operations in the different laboratories
‘and the measurement outcomes are labelled by

some classical variables xcand ai(with 4 < /'< N), respectively;
for simplicity we assume that the x's and

als take a finite number of values. Defining the vector

of settings ~x = (1, ... as) and the vector of outcomes
~a=(as,..., ai), the device-independent description of
the correlations established in such an experiment is encoded
in the conditional probability R~a\~>X)

Causal inequalities [32] are constraints on A~a\~X derived
From the assumption that there exists an underlying

causal structure defining the order between parties. (p. 13)

Vi CAUSAL INEQUALITIES
The notion of causal separability considered above

relies on the quantum description of the local laboratories.

One may ask what are the constraints imposed by

a definite causal structure regardless of the specific description,
or even the physics governing the devices performing

the local operations. To study such restrictions,

we will make use of so-called causal inequalities [15],

which bound the possible correlations that can be established
