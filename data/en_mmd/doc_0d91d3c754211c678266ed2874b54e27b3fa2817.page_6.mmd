Give Thanks

You have shown me favour unending
You have given Your life for me

‘And my heart knows of Your goodness
Your blood has covered me

| wil arise and give thanks
To You Lord my God

‘And Your name | will bless
‘With my whole heart

You have shown mercy

You have shown mercy to me
I give thanks to You Lord

You have poured out
Your healing upon us

You have set the captives free

‘And we know it's not what we've done
But by Your hand alone

‘We will arise and give thanks
To You Lord our God

‘And Your name we will less
‘With our whole hearts

You have shown mercy

You have shown mercy to us
‘We give thanks to You Lord

Who You Say We Are
(Oh how great is the love

The Father has lavished on us
That we should be called

The children of God

(Oh how great was the cost
The Father was willing to pay
So we could be called

The children of God

(Chorus) And all that we can say
Is thank You, thank You

{And all that we can say

Is thank You, thank You

We are Your sons

We are Your daughters

Hallelujah, we are who You say we are
So we lift our hands and cry Abba Father
Hallelujah, we are who You say we are
Hallelujah, we are who You say we are

(Oh how great is Your amazing grace
That took us as orphans and slaves
‘And made us Your heirs

‘And gave us Your name

There's nothing more

That we could ever do

You finished ital on the cross

‘And rose from the grave

‘And brought us with You (To Chorus)
