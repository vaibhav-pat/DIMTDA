Irrigation management
Proportional mixing of good quality (if available) water with
saline water and then using for irigation reduces the effeet of salinity.

Altemate furrow irrigation favours growth of plant than flooding. Drip,

sprinkler and pitcher irrigation have been found to be more efficient than

the conventional flood irigation method since rel

ively lesser amount of

‘water is used under these improved methods.

Fertilizer management
‘Addition of extra dose of nitrogen to the tune of 20-25% of

recommended level will compen

the low availablity of N in these

soils. Addition of organic manures like, FYM, compost, ete helps in

reducing the ill effect of salinity due to release of organie acids produced
‘during decomposition. Green manuring (Sunhemp, Daincha, Kolingi) and

‘or green leaf manuring also counteracts the effects of salinity.

Crop choice / Crop management
Crops are to be chosen based on the soil salinity level. The

‘relative salt tolerance of different crops is as follows:
