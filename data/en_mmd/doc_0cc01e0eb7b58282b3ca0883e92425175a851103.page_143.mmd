What...? Frank Corsaro! Right, he’s directing Night
of the Iguana, uh-huh?
DAVIS
And I’m not starring.

TENNESSEE
Yes, you are—‘cause I brought Frankie to opening
night!
DAVIS
Not a whisper!
TENNESSEE
Frank Merlo. That’s why I’m here. It was before

anything bad happened and I think I deserve to relive
one good memory from my wretched personal life!

DAVIS
I’m not going on while that fucker claims to be a
director!

TENNESSEE
You can’t switch director night of—that defeats the
purpose!

DAVIS
No.
