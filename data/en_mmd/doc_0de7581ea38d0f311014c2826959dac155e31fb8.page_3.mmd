What is Child Protection?
Child Protection helps children to be safe.

Itis run by the government.

The staff see how you look after your children.

They also talk to:

+ day care centre staff

+ school staff

+ other family.

Child Protection may say everything is OK.
Like:

* there is food your child can eat

+ your child has a safe place to sleep.

That is good.
