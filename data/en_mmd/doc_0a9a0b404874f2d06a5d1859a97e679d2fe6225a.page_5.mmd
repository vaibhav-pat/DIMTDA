was dedicated at a service held
on 29" May [Whit Sunday]
1887.

Although recorded as a yeoman
farmer in 1881, his family had
made their fortune as Wine and
Spirit Merchants on High
Street, Nantwich in Cheshire,
firstly under his widowed father
William Hall before John, his
only son, took over the
business by the 1860s
supported by his three sisters:
Elizabeth, Frances and Alice.
The link with Shropshire was
established when Frances
married William Moss in 1864,
a Cheshire man but who was
now a farmer of 800 acres
living at New Street, Wem. By
the 1870s William had
purchased Holbrook Farm in
Clive, but he died aged 60 years
in 1877 — an event which,
combined with the recent
decease of John’s father
William in 1870 and his sister
Alice in 1876, appears to have
prompted John Hall to leave
the Wine profession and to

become a gentleman farmer by
taking up the freehold of
Holbrook Hall and Farm.
Despite being a confirmed
bachelor well into his fifties, he
also managed to acquire a wife,
Charlotte who was a Cheshire
resident. They are both
recorded in the 1881 census —
John (60 years) and Charlotte
(59 years) employing five farm
labourers/servants prior to
John’s death aged 68 only eight
years later.

‘A measure of the success of the
family business was reflected in

John Hall's estate being valued
at £32,235 [over £3.5 million in
today’s money]. One of his
executors was named as the
farmer Joseph William Calcott
of Betton Abbotts, another
Cheshire family who eventually
took over Holbrook Hall
