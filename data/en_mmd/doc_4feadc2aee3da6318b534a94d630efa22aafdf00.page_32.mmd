‘After presenting the analogy between their version ofthe lotery paradox and Red

(Cab-like cases, Enoch etal hold that the reason why individual evidence is more highly

Valued than bare statistical evidence is because of sensitivity. This account relies on

‘thinking in terms of counterfactuals.” Inthe lottery cases they present, this materializes
in terms of what belies one would have ifone's ticket were in fact the winner. In the B

version, which relies on bare statistical evider

‘one would still have access to all the
same information ~ thus, if one believed that one were going to lose inthe original B

version, one would still believe that one would lose even if one held the wit

i ticket. It
is otherwise when considering the A version. In the A version, one’s beliefs in part,
informed by the newspaper printing a different number than the number on one’s ticket.

However, ift were true that one held the wi

newspaper would print the

umber held on one’s ticket. And because the newspaper

Would have printed the matching ticket

n the B version,
hhad the ticketholder’s belief that he lost been false, he would mos likely still believe that
he had los.

Enoch etal hold that this attention to counterfaetuals is

epistemic good."
Much like Thomson, they stress that having a tre belief that one will lose in the B

version could just be an “epistemic fluke" —it just happens to be a true belief. On the
