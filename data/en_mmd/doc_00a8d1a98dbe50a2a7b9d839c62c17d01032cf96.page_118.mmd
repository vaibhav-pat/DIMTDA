New legislation that affects substantive rights may have retroactive effect if itis
possible to disc a clear legislative intent that it is to apply
retrospectively. Procedural legislation designed to govern only the manner in
which rights are asserted or enforced is presumed to apply
immediately. Procedural provisions that affect substantive rights in their
application are not purely procedural and do not apply immediately. On the other
hand, procedural provisions that only affect the exercise of substantive rights are
procedural and apply immediately: A v Chouhan, 2021 SCC 26 (but see Abella
J's dissent)

THIRD PARTY RECORDS

A. CROWN’S DUTY

‘The Crown is not an ordinary litigant in the criminal courtroom or on appeal, its
Undivided loyalty being to the proper administration of justice. When Crown

‘appears baseless, the Crown is duty-bound as an officer of the court to make
inquiries of the police to obtain that information where its “reasonably feasible to
do so”: A v Esseghaier, 2021 ONCA 162, at para 26

B, O'CONNOR REGIME
