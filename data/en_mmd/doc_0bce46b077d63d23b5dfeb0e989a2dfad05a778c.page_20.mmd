“conspiratorial volce* What went down between Ira and Louise? What went down?

JARRAH:
So Grace, did you have any things that you felt were missing that you hoped would've made it in
there?

GRACE:
Oh, there's many. Many incredible just one-off quest stars that- we talk about recurring cast
members and we briefly get to talk about the fact that Jettrey Comes gets shot by “laughs* one
