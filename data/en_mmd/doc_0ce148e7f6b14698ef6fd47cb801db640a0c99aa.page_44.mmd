Depending on the power of the asynchronous motors, their efficiency at the rated load
can be in the range from 83 to 95% (the upper limit corresponds to the high-power engines).

Methods of regulating an asynchronous motor speed
1) changing the frequency of the current (voltage) f= var.
2) Change in the number of pairs of poles.
3) Speed regulation due to voltage variation.
4) Speed control by changing the slip factor (for the phase structure rotor).
Reverse of asynchronous motor
‘To reverse an asynchronous motor, you need to swap any two phases. This will change

the direction of rotation of the motor rotor.

asynchronous motor, plotted in relative units

In addition, an important indicator is the overload capacity factor ks, and for squirrel-
cage motors — also the multiplicity of starting current and starting torque.
