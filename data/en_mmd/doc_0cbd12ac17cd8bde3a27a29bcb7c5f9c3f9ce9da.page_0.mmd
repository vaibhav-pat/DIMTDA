World War 2 started on st September 1939 and ended 2nd September
1945. It all began when German troops invaded Poland. The UK declared
g ‘4 g
war on Germany on 3 September 1939. It was announced by Prime Minister
y
s Neville Chamberlain. While many countries were involved in the war, they o
Bg each took sides — either with the Allies, or the Axis. The main Axis countries
g were Germany, Italy and Japan. The main Allied countries were Great g
g nied 3 3
s Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union (Russia). British g
ao Prime Ministers during World War Il were Neville Chamberlain until
g 1940, then Winston Churchill. World War Il ended in Europe on 8 May g
Bg 11945 - this is also known as VE Day (Victory in Europe Day). World War I
carried on for a few months after it ended in Europe, and officially ended
g when Japan formally surrendered to the Allies on 2 September 1945 (also g
rs i ia ry
a called VJ Day). The UK was part of the Allies. Two types of aeroplane were ry
FA used in the Battle of Britain — bombers that dropped bombs on towns and A
B cities and fighters that attacked other aeroplanes. The main aeroplanes A
g flown by the RAF were fighters called the Spitfire and the Hurricane. They g
g tried to destroy German bombers before they could attack British towns
Bo and cities. The Luftwaffe, (Germany's air force) used both bombers and B
s fighters. They used the bombers to attack towns and cities, and the fighters H
to stop the RAF fighters from destroying German bombers. The German's
go most famous fighter aeroplane was the Messerschmitt and their main g
g bombers were the Heinkel, the Junkers and the Dornier. British Prime g
a Minister Winston Churchill, US President Franklin Roosevelt and Soviet
s Union leader Joseph Stalin were known as the ‘big three’. They were all g
Hi leaders of Allied countries. The code name for D-day was ‘Operation A
Overlord’. D-Day is a name the military use when planning an event - the
g ‘D’ does not stand for anything. The code name for the evacuation of Allied g
a troops from Dunkirk was ‘Operation Dynamo’. Hitler's plan to invade Britain
in the summer of 1940 was called ‘Operation Sea Lion’.
