‘The ULTRA mechanism advances over prior reform efforts because (1) the
notional equity interest it offers to the government counteracts the incentives for
deferral-based tax games, (2) it alleviates the political optionality concerns of
retrospective and realization-based reforms, (3) its unique separated-aecounts and
take-itorleave-it alternative valuation methodologies together readily manage
the issues ereated by contributions, partial withdrawals, and deemed withdeawals—
including personal-level borrowing, and (4) it resolves the jurisdictional isues
that might otherwise interfere with state-level attempts at reaching mobile
taxpayers." Together, we have argued that these innovations of the ULTRA
mechanism suffice to offer a general-purpose plug for a wide variety of eritical tax
Valuation holes.

Without a solution for plugging valuation holes, tax systems cannot
effectively address rising inequality. We have argued that our proposed ULTRA

mechanism answers these problems. By using ULTRAS to plug tax valuation holes,
Wwe can feasibly reform our tax systems to reach extreme wealth,

‘our proposed approach to interim distributions under a mark-to-market income tax
reform. Again, our basic proposal is that each year an applicable taxpayer's
assets Would become subject to an ULTRA equal to the prevailing top marginal
{ax rate on investments times a deemed rate of return." Then, atthe time of the
sale ofall of the assets or other resolution of the ULTRA, the taxpayer's results
would be “trued up" to their actual rate of return using a retrospective formula, As
