© The introduction of the State Liability Amendment Bill at this
stage, and prior to the Law Reform Commission completing its

investigation, is premature.

+ The proposed manner of structuring the “periodic payments” is
unworkable.

+ The Rt 000 000 threshold is arbitrary.

+ Providing for an injured claimant to be directed back tothe very

facility where the wrong was perpetrated to begin with, offends
the Constitution

+ Restricting @ Court's discretion regarding the imposition of
periodic payments is unsupportable

+ The Bills intended retrospective application is neither justifiable

nor reasonable and most probably unconstitutional

We would welcome the opportunity to make an oral presentation to the Portfolio

Committee with reference to these submissions.
