Construction of a two-layer reduced stator winding

Construct a two-layer, shortened and distributed stator winding with parameters: m:
(four-pole machine) with reduction B=5/6.

Conclusion: the winding circuit determines the number of stator poles.

‘This field is created by three-phase symmetrical currents of the stator winding. A ro-
tating circular magnetic field rotates in the air with a velocity m.
A circular rotating magnetic field is the total field from all currents of the stator wind-
ing. The maximum sum of these fields rotates in the air with speed
