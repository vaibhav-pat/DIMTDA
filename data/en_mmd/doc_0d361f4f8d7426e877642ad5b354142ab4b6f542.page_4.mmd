Brother, sister, let me serve you;
let me be as Christ to you;
pray that | may have the grace to
let you be my servant too.

We are pilgrims on a journey,
and companions on the road;
we are here to help each other
walk the mile and bear the load.

| will hold the Christ-light for you
in the night-time of your fear;
I will hold my hand out to you,
speak the peace you long to hear.

| will weep when you are weeping;
When you laugh I'll augh with you;
{will share your joy and sorrow,

till we've seen this journey through

When we sing to God in heaven,
‘we shall find such harmony,

born of all we've known together
of Christ's love and agony.

Brother, sister, let me serve you;
let me be as Christ to you;
pray that | may have the grace to
let you be my servant too.
