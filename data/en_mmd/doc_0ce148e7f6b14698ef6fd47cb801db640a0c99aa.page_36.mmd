At start up asynchronous motors have two drawbacks:

1) There is a large inrush current, fna=5-8 Lv

2) A small starting torque is created that is less than the rated torque.

Fig. 3.3 ~ Asynchronous motor starting characteristies

We can see the disadvantages of direct start at the graph.
‘To improve the starting characteri is necessary to increase the active resistance
of the rotor winding, but only during the start period.
For this, the rotor grooves are made deep and narrow, and the skin-effect is used — it is
the effect of displacement of the current to the surface of the rotor.

1-4 — deep grooves: 5-6 — shaped grooves; 7-8 — double winding

‘The skin-effect increases the active resistance of the rotor winding by the start.
‘The phenomenon of the skin-effect is that the magnetic field of the stator current does
not immediately penetrate the entire depth of the rotor grooves. But immediately induced
