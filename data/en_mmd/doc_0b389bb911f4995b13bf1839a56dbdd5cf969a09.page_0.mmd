Abstract
When faced with « mulitade of resarch parcipants’ voices, perceptions, and interpretations in
ualitative fedwork, researchers ofen resort to wht we call “common sense coding’ to analyze the
pirical material. wing commonsensicl reasoning based on the Arsotl's tational laws of

the insights we as rescarchers can draw from the material. We thus argue to no neglect but instead
emphasize ‘counter-aratves’ a altemative analytical strategies ~ inthe form of untold stores and

deconstruction, multip

coding. We unfold the theoretical and methodological implications of a counter-narative lens and

illustrate how it may enable us to analyze empirical data in more nuanced ways.
