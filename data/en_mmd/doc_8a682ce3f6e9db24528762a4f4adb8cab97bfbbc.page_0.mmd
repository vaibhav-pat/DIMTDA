Abstract
Title
Rib Fracture Management ~ A Collaborative Approach
Background

‘Our experience at SRFT as a level 1 Trauma Centre has seen an significant
increase in patients with blunt chest trauma injuries complicated by fractured ribs
which in turn are associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to respiratory
compromise. To ensure safe effective and timely care a multidisciplinary clinical
care pathway for the management of rib fractures has been developed.

Aims

+ Ensure all patients with fractured ribs receive a targeted assessment,
ssignposting appropriate care through an interdisciplinary team approach.

* Clinical care guidelines promote the best possible outcome for the patient.

* Collaboration between the stakeholders that promotes seamless care for the
patient.

Objectives

+ To prevent deterioration of respiratory function
+ To ensure that the level of care is appropriate to the patients clinical needs.
+ To disseminate the care pathway process to the key stakeholders.

Methods

‘The rib fracture policy / pathway was instigated by the pain management team with a
collaborative approach to ensure that all Key stakeholders were able to contribute. A
number of meetings were arranged and attended and various draft policies produced,
‘Once all in agreement a final policy / pathway was produced and integrated into
clinical practice.

Main results

+ A.working policy / pathway developed by clinicians’ in collaboration.
* Guidelines signposting pain management standards and appropriate referral
+ Asseamless care pathway from admission to discharge.

Conclusion (Key Points)

Collaboration is the corner stone which ensures patients with fractured ribs receive
the most effective, timely treatment needed. Individual clinicians cannot provide
effective treatment alone, without the support and expertise of other teams, if the
best outcome for the patient is to be achieved.
