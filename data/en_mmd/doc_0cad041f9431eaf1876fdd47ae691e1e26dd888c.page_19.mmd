BINGO Challenge “ee

Throughout the PE curriculum we cover a range of different sports and physical
activities. Below is a taste of some fitness challenges our students complete.

Each line you complete = 10 points
If you complete them all, “full house’ = 70 points (an extra 10 points!)

If you complete them all you can then add in your own bingo stations in the
spaces below. If you complete them easily, you can make them harder by

repeating the stations more than once or by increasing the time or amount of
repetitions for each station.
