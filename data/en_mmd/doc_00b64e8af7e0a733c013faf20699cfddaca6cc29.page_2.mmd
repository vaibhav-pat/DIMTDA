In spring, it helps butterflies refuel after winter hibernation or a gruelling journey to Britain
from southern Europe or Africa
Another way to help butterflies is to allow them to breed in your garden - only with the right
foodplants can they lay eggs ofthe next generation, and so the more we grow for them, the more
butterflies there willbe
Tips on how to attract butterflies:

‘choose sunny, sheltered spots when planting nectar plants
choose different plants to atract a wider variety of species
plant flowers that flower through all seasons (spring flowers are vital to support butterflies,
‘coming out of hibernation)
don’t use insecticides or pesticides
