CAPOTE exits. FRANK immediately goes to
sit, the occasional cough curling him like a
pill bug.

WARHOL
How are you feeling, sweetie?

WARHOL sits, TENN staring only at
FRANK. CAPOTE enters with wine and a
corkscrew.

CAPOTE
Angel, this cork is milk white. How did you know?

WARHOL
Because you don’t shut up.

CAPOTE
This bottle’s only for me. And maybe a sip for Tenn:
pallet royalties.
TENNESSEE

No. (no response) No, of course I’m drinking.

WARHOL
Frankie, would you like some soup?

CAPOTE
Soup?! It’s a thousand degrees outside!
