Furthermore, the new radio interface technologies for IMT-2020 specified by 3GPP enable use of
the frequency band 4 800-4 990 MHL by a band plan for TDD called Band 79,

Based on APT Recommendation on Use of the Band 4940-4990 Mllz for Public Protection and
Disaster Relief (PPDR) Applications (APT/AWF/REC-O1(Rev.1)), APT also recommends, for
‘guidance of APT member administrations, the frequency band 4940-4990 MH or parts thereof
may be used to support broadband networks designed for PPDR high rate data and video
information transfer

In Radio Regulations Resolution 223 (Rey. WRC-19) invites ITU-R2 fo study the technical and
regulatory conditions for the protection of stations of the AMS and the maritime mobile service
(MMS) located in international airspace or waters (i-e. outside national territories) and operated
in the frequency band 4 800-4 990 MH. In addition, it should be noted that some APT countries
‘addressed thatthe sharing and compatibility studies between IMT and other systems need to be
considered before implementing IMT in 4 800-4 990 MHz(see 49 Question 9 of No.
