7.1 Changes to MLMD

‘A change to the device could include a modification to the machine learning model, algorithm,
weights, or parameters. MLMD is ina locked state when changes are not permitted. Aspects that
describe these changes include the cause, effect trigger, domain, timing, and effectuation. These
attributes describe what changes, as well as why, where, when, and how the MLMD change occurs.

[Note : The word "locked" has been used by the community in a number of diferent ways, Some
hhave defined a "locked device" as one that has been developed using ML methods but for which
the developer does not have an intention of modifying at the present time. Others have used the

tem "locked device" as any device that does not perform "continuous learning.” When using the
word "locked" itis important to provide clarifying language around its use to communicate how it
is being used

re Aspe of ILM Chan

‘The cause refers tothe source ofthe change to the MLMD, for example, re-training with new or
appended data or new training methods, algorithny/model, tuning, etc

‘The effect refers to the resulting change to the MLMD, which can include amended intended
usefindications for use: modified performance, changes in inputs, outputs, etc.

‘The trigger refers to the event that prompts or instigates the change to the MLMD, which can
include performance thresholds, training data bateh-size thresholds, exposure to new
datalexperiences, scheduled time nental changes, user feedback, ete

‘The domain refers to the scope or applicable extent of the change to the MLMD, which can be
categorized as either homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous change is a uniform change
that occurs universally (Sometimes referred to as a global adaptation, note that global does not
