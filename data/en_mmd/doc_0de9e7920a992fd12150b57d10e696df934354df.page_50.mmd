+ After receiving initial notice from the Head of School about school closure and
timelines, families will ceive an email from the US Principal with division-specific
information

+ The primary tools for communication between teachers and students are
PowerSchool, Google Classroom and zoom, and newsletters via email

+ Teachers will either link materials linked in their PowerSchool class pages or
‘Google Classroom materials shared directly to each student’s Google Drive

+ Leaning experiences are designed to be completed independently or in
collaboration with other students. Tutoring is not recommended, nor should a
parent/guardian be too involved.

+ Online classes would occur at the same time as they would in the normal Upper
School schedule. For example, if students had Math first block on a B day, then that
is when they are expected to be working on Math.

+ Being taught online does NOT mean students need to be on the computer all
day. Many activities can be completed off-line. The key is that at the beginning of
‘each lesson students check in with the lesson plan provided by the teacher and get,
to work.

+ Most of the work should be completed during the allotted class time. Like a
regular class, there may be some additional work to be done outside of the class, but
most can (and should) be done during the 50 minute class.

+ Students will use the same online platforms (Haiku/Google Classroom) that they
‘currently use with their teachers. Additionally, teachers can offer some screencasts
Of presentations for students to view. Teachers can also use the video software
Zoom to hold real-time class discussions, which can also be recorded and watched at
a later date.
