hard to see what's wrong with penetration from desites and fears as opposed to beliefs. There is
pethaps something vaguely (though, for reasons just mentioned, not strictly) circular about
believing that p, which causes you to see that p, which causes you to belive that p. But desires

Furthermore, atleast inthe anecdotal cases, desires can have opposite effects:
sometimes the desire that p makes me more likely to see that p, while other times a very stron

either could be a matter of circularity, given that they're not beliefs, but even harder to see how

they both could, given their opposite natures.
