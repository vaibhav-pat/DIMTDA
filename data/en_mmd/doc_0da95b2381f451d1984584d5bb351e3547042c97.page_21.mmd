Optimal Windows of Trainability

‘An athlete's overall fitness level may be influenced by a number of factors, five of which should
be considered vital components when considering LTAD:

‘+ Stamina (Endurance) Skill
+ Strength ‘+ Suppleness (Flexibility)
+ Speed

Each of the above components should be considered trainable, meaning that each can
improve or decline at varied rates in response to training. In addition, each component has an.
‘optimal window of trainability (OWT), meaning that if children or adolescents attempt to
train any of these components too early in their development age they will return minimal
results in relation to the time and effort used in training,

The table below indicates the OWT for boys and girls, for each of the five vital components of
fitness.
