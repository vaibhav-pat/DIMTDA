Create a poster explaining the dangers of cold water shock
How can you minimise the risk?

It you enter the water unexpectedly:

+ Take a minute. The initial effects of cold water pass in less than a minute so
don't try to swim straight away.

+ Relax and float on your back to catch your breath. Try to get hold of
â€˜something that will help you float.

+ Keep calm then call for help or swim for safety if you're able.

If you're planning on enjoying the water:

+ Check conditions - including water temperature - before heading to the
coast. Visit magicseaweed.com for full surf reports in the UK and Ireland.
+ Wear a wetsuit of appropriate thickness for the amount of time you plan to
spend in the water and the type of activity you're doing, if entering,
+ Wear a flotation device. It greatly increases your chances of making it
through the initial shock. See our quidance on lifejackets and buoyancy,
