‘A changeover contact operated by the points movement is required. This Feeds IRDASC A with the
send "S* of whichever IRDASC the route is et for.

Resetting Signal When a tain passes a signal that signal will stay at red until the train teaches the
IRDASC-4 controlling the next signal. If the wain is sent into a siding ori lifted from the track the
next signal is never reached leaving the signal permanently at red even though the track ahead has
become clear. To reset the signal from red either:

‘Wire a switeh fo connect terminal "R" to terminal "0" (one second operation will clear signal and upon
releasing the switch its aspect will be set by the aspect of the signal ahead. Or use an irdot-1D on the
start of the siding and wire terminal 2 of the IRDOT to the "R® terminal.

Combining different aspect signals IRDASC4s controlling signals with different numbers of
aspects can be combined together. For example as a railway line approaches a terminus station there
‘could be a 4 aspect then 3 aspect and finally 2 aspect signal. t would be incorrect for the signal
immediately before the end of the ine to be 4 aspect Similarly it would be meaningless to have a4
aspect signal before a 2 aspect one.
