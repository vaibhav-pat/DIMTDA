Elaine Allyn, SOGRE: Proposed moving from Category 2 to Category 3
Hard to understand and quantify measurement
Lujuana Medina, SoCal REN: On behalf of SoCAL REN, proposed moving
from Category 2 to Category 3.

Lucy Morris, PG&E: Believed the intent was to simply use the TSB and
asked for confirmation. Noted that Equity 46 is the one that was expected
to be calculated using the TSB and not another test.

‘= Elaine Allyn, SDG8E: Noted a similar confusion of how to use TSB
Unless actually installing equipment. Noted that other benefits
such as "holistic’ ones in the equity segment do not have TSB
within the CET.

Elaine Allyn, SOGRE: Noted confusion of meaning of ‘Equity Market
Support’ and ‘Equity Resource Acquisition’

‘= Lucy Morris, PGRE: Clarified that its determining the amount of
people receiving the type of activity, for example, whether its
‘equipment installation or information and awareness raising.

= Elaine Allyn, SDGRE: Noted confusion because there are Market
Support and Resource Acquisition segments

= Jenn Mitchell Jackson, BayREN: Noted that this conversation came
Up at one conversation at @ subgroup meeting and not fully talked
about at the EMWG and therefore might not be appropriate to
include. Provided an example from BayREN: listed folks who did
and did not contribute to energy savings. Direct energy savings or
indirect energy savings.

'= Elaine Allyn, SDGRE: Proposed to clarify verbiage.

= Lujuana Medina, SoCal REN: Continued efforts to complicate
metrics requires more resources. As a REN, can only imagine IOU
portfolios trying to distinguish all these activities. Would be time
‘consuming and may lead to inaccuracies. Propose coming up with
‘easy and well-defined metrics and pulling from the CRM.

Laurel Rothschild, The Energy Coalition: Suggested prioritizing this metric
to move from Category 3 to Category 2 because it should take precedence
‘over indicators in Category 3.

Kevin Ehsani, SoCalGas: Proposed moving metric from Category 3 to
Category 2.
