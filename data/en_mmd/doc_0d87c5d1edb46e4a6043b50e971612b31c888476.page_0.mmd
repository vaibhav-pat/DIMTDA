Miriam Lexmann, on behalf of the PPE Group. ~ Madam President, let me start by
thanking the rapporteur and the fellow shadows for very good cooperation while
drafting this recommendation, Multilateralism, if itis to continue to be relevant, must
be effective. I believe that there are four fundamental aspects which we need to
address to ensure that they continue to benefit from the multilateral cooperation and
from the institutions and that they serve the causes of freedom and human dignity

Fi discussion and direction

we finally need a strong and comprehe:

from the EU Member States about the EUâ€™s role in the world. Second, we need to put

our value: ily support for freedom and democracy, at the heart of our

espe

multilateral agenda. Third, we must not be afraid to reform multilateral fora that are

falling short, for example the Human Rights Council abused by authoritarian regimes

and with a Fourth, we must build the resilience of multilateral

fora against the malign influence of authoritarian regimes, in particular the

Communist Party in China,

I believe the free world has an important stake in ensuring that the multilateral system
remains relevant and resilient. We need to be ambitious, have a clear strategy, and

defend freedom.
