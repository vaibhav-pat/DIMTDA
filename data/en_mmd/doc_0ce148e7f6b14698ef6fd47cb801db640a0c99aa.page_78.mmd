‘Schemes for the inclusion of field windings in DC machines

For DC electric machines, 4 circuits of excitation windings are used: parallel, sequen-
tial, mixed, independent. Generators do not use sequential excitation.

d— consecutive excitation

‘The basic equation of the DC generator
Us = E- IeRne
where U, ~ the voltage that is applied to the anchor of motor;
E—EME, which is induced in the anchor winding; fs — anchor current;
Re — main circuit resistance of the anchor.
Ro = Ro+ Rap + Row + f\R io)
Re — the resistance of the anchor winding:
Ray ~ the resistance of the additional poles:
Ro. ~ the resistance of the compensating winding:
fiRj.) — resistance of the field winding, taking into account the circuit of its activation,

‘The basic equation of the DC motor
U, = E+ leRoe
For the motor, the calculation of the voltage is not very important. It is necessary to
know the frequency of rotation. We will carry out calculations:
