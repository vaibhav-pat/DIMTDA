+ Teachers will either link materials linked in their PowerSchool class pages or
Google Classroom materials shared directly to each student’s Google Drive
+ Learning experiences are designed to be completed independently or in
collaboration with other students. Tutoring is not recommended, nor should a
parent/guardian be too involved.
+ Online classes would occur at the same time as they would in the normal Upper
School schedule. For example, if students had Math first block on a B day, then that
is when they are expected to be working on Math.
+ Being taught online does NOT mean students need to be on the computer all
day. Many activities can be completed off-line. The key is that at the beginning of
‘each lesson students check in with the lesson plan provided by the teacher and get,
to work.
+ Most of the work should be completed during the allotted class time. Like a
regular class, there may be some additional work to be done outside of the class, but
most can (and should) be done during the 50 minute class.
+ Students will use the same online platforms (Haiku/Google Classroom) that they
‘currently use with their teachers. Additionally, teachers can offer some screencasts
Of presentations for students to view. Teachers can also use the video software
‘Zoom to hold real-time class discussions, which can also be recorded and watched at
later date.
+ Resources vary by class and lesson, but will include links to videos, graphic
‘organizers to complete, scanned material to read and engage with, independent
research material via Newsela and our databases, reading materials.
+ Students are encouraged to be proactive in reaching out to teachers when they
have questions or assignments are unclear.
+ Counselors and advisors are always available to support students with academic,
social, or emotional needs.
