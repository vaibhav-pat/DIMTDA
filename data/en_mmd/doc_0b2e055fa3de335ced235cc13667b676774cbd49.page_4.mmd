ALEX: Right.

BENTON: It's easy for me to be an activist about it, as long as |
am not affected by it. So, | think in a particular sense we try to
build a certain aspect of community, but | again | think people
are very settled in their own way, and they really don't think
about the bigger ramifications of it outside of their own personal
little space.

ALEX: Yeah.

BENTON: You know, this is a very diverse city. Part of the issue
I think that the level of diversity — those stories are not told — you
can see your neighbor, and you can think well this person has
come to Canada, but we don't know where they came from or
what their back story is. So many people. | think it’s important for
us to keep reminding ourselves, where we are coming from, and
in a certain particular way, what unites us. We need to just
document our lives. Document our aspect of our journey and the
fact that we were here.
