‘The rule against conflicts guards against two forms of prejudice: first, there is
prejudice as a result of the lawyer's misuse of confidential information obtained
{rom a client; and second, there is prejudice arising where the lawyer ‘soft peddles’
his representation of a client in order to serve his own interests, those of another
client, or those of a third person.

With respect to former clients, lawyers must refrain from misusing confidential
information. Whereas, for current clients, lawyers must not misuse confidential
information, nor place themselves in a situation that jeopardizes effective
representation.

A lawyer can render effective assistance only when that lawyer champions the
accused's cause with undivided loyalty. Effective representation may be
threatened where a lawyer is tempted to prefer other interests over those of their
client. There should be no room for doubt about counse!'s loyalty and dedication
to the client's case. A lawyer's duty of loyalty to their client is foundational to the
‘adversarial system and “essential to the integrity of the administration of justice.

To determine where a conflict of interest causes a denial of the accused's
constitutional right to make a full answer and defence, and results in a miscarriage
of justice, the applicant must show:

‘an actual conflict of interest between the respective interests represented by
‘counsel; and

‘as a result of that conflict, some impairment of counsel's ability to represent
effectively the interests of the appellant.

If both criteria are established, then the applicant has been denied the right to
make full answer and defence and a miscarriage of justice has occurred.

It is not enough simply to have an appearance of a conflict. The court must
determine whether counse''s representation was, in fact, adversely affected. The
concern on appeal must be with what happened and not what might have
happened.

It the trial counse''s representation of an accused may be compromised by a duty
to a former client, counsel should first advise the new client and obtain their
consent. If counsel believes that the duly to the former client actually wil
‘compromise the new retainer, then the lawyer should decline to accept the case:
