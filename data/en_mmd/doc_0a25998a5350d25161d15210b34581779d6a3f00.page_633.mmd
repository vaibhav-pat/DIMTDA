247 The Size of the Strange Loop that Constitutes a Self

248 Nonetheless, a dog, saliently lacking an arbitrarily
extensible concept repertoire and therefore possessing only a rudimentary
episodic memory (and of course totally lacking any permanent storehouse of
imagined future events strung out along a mental timeline, let alone
counterfactual scenarios hovering around the past, the present, and even the

human, and for that reason a dog has a far smaller soul
