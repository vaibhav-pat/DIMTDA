IV. Labor Contingent Songs

Never Keep Us Down
(Cm)

‘By Martha Hawthorne, Labor Contingent

Estamos en lucha, podemos ya
Resist todo fo malo que nos da
pueblo unido, jamais sera vencido
No nos maveran

Everybody rise up singing
Hear us the whale world round
‘An injury to one is an injury to all
They will never keep us down

They will never keep us down ‘No nos méveron

Come on everybody and sing with me
‘No chains will keep us bound

‘Stand up, fight back, look’em in the eye
They will never keep us down

They will never keep us down
