Title of Report

mobility devices are bodily extensions crucial to a disabled person's
wellbeing and movement, especially in the event of an emergency.

Make sure exits are clearly marked in case of emergency. Ushers should
know all exit locations because they will assist people to find the closest
exits. An evacuation plan is crucial. Clergy, ushers, and others on staff must
be aware of the procedures should an evacuation be necessary.

Seat Locations
Many congregants who are wheelchair users prefer to sit with family and
friends, just like anyone else. Too often they are placed in the “wheelchair
section,” a location at the front of the sanctuary or in the back. Do all you
can to seat people where they want to be seated. Avoid putting wheelchair
users in the center and side aisles. This is unsafe and can be very
uncomfortable.

Tips for Improving the Accessibility of Your Community

+ Anumber of companies rent and install temporary small ramps for
sanctuary access. While not a permanent solution, it's important to
include access requirements in your budget. Make sure elevators are
in working order and available for use. Include the location of
elevators in service handouts and announcements.

+ Pathways should be free from obstructions with wide doorways and
wide aisles to accommodate those who use wheelchairs, walkers,
canes, crutches, and scooters as ambulatory devices.

+ Make sure floors are clean and dry, as water, leaves, dust, and paper
make surfaces slippery and unsafe.

+ Make sure there are spaces for wheelchair users to sit and participate
in the service. This may include pew cuts or spaces between chairs
designated for wheelchairs users.

+ Accessible restrooms are a must. Everyone should be able to use the
restroom! Gender-neutral restrooms should also be accessible.

+ Install ramps to the pulpit. Invite all people to access the pulpit using
the ramp.
+ Ifa ramp isn’t available, move podiums, altars, and tables to the floor

level. An architect table is a low-cost way to ensure access for readers
and service participants who use mobility devices.
