Before you go into Court, tell your lawyer:
+ where you want to see your child

+ when you want to see your child.

Like every 2 days at home.

Your lawyer will talk to you about what the Court
might say is OK. Like 2 afternoons a week in a

Child Protection room.

Your lawyer will tell the court.

The judge listens to all the lawyers.
The judge will decide how many times a week

you can see your child. This is called Contact.
