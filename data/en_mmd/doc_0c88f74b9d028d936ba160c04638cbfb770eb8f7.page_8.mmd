‘Remember Me Revelation Song
‘On the night You were betrayed Worthy isthe Lamb Who was slain
You took the bread Holy, holy is He
After giving thanks Sing a new song to Him Who sits on
You broke it and said Heaven's mercy seat
This is My body broken for you
‘And as You eat it remember Me (Chorus) Holy, holy, holy
This is body broken for You Is the Lord God Almighty
‘And as You eat it remember Me Who was and is and is to come
With all creation I sing
‘On the night You were betrayed Praise to the King of kings
You held the cup You are my everything
After giving thanks You lifted it up ‘And | will adore You
This is My blood poured out for you
‘And as you drink it eemember Me Clothed in rainbows of living color
This is My blood poured out for you Flashes of lightning rolls of thunder
‘And as you drink it eemember Me Blessing and honor, strength and glory
‘And power be to You the only wise king
‘So we thank You for the wine (To Chorus)
‘And for the bread
For we see the life You gave Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
‘And the blood You shed {At the mention of Your name
‘And we remember Your wondrous love Jesus Your name is power,
You gave Your body Breath and living water
You shed Your blood Such a marvelous mystery
‘And we remember Your wondrous love (To Chorus)

You gave Your body
You shed Your blood
