Unit 1:
‘Activity 6, Exercise 2: Language fun facts

‘A. The students’ curiosity about different languages was hopefully piqued by the previous
task and they are eager to learn more. The next task may also be completed within their
{groups or as pair work. Provide each group of learners with “Handout G: Language fun

facts", Give your learners a few minutes to think about the questions and decide whether
they think the facts are true or false. If your learners are not proficient enough in English,
you may either want to read and translate the questions with them or translate the
sentences (possibly also with the help of translation tools such as DeepL.

the handout in several languages.
