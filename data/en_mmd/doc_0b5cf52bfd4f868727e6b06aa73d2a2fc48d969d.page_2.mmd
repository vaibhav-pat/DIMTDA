Resurgence of dispensational eschatology

- What tools do I need as a leader

facing the challenge?

1. Need to be rooted

“So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in
him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and
overflowing with thankfulness. See to it that no one takes you captive through
hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the
elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ.” Colossians 2:6-8
NIV

2, Need to renew our confidence in the power of the Gospel, the
transformational power of Water Baptism, and the release of the
power in the Baptism in the Spirit.

“Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of
Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the
Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far oft —
for all whom the Lord our God will cal.”” Acts 2:38-39 NIV

3. Need to make our focus to be conformed to the image of Jesus in
ur pursuit of building God's Church

“For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of
his Son, that he might be the firstbom among many brothers and sisters.”
Romans 8:29 NIV

4, Need to give credible answers to 21st century issues
