Clive Church — The Willis Organ Restoratio1

‘An essential part of the 1885
modernisation of Clive Church was
the inclusion in C.1.Ferguson’s
designs of an organ chamber and
vestry located behind two arches,
and both fronted by an ornate
carved screen, Therefore the
provision of a church organ was an
integral part of the overall plan from
the onset; and conceived as a key
component within the overall
architectural concept, it remains a
major addition to the quality of the
project.

This essential pattern can be clearly
witnessed in the outstanding quality
of the wood carving where the two
screens (carved by Simpson and
‘Aumonier) compliment the pulpit
(Knox) and the choir stalls (Rodis) ~
all examples of the “exquisite

modern woodwork by the best
English carvers [Shropshire ~The
Little Guides. J.€. Auden, 1912.
P 103}.

This workmanship explains the

decision made by the benefactors to
focus primarily upon investing in the
quality of the musical instrument,
and thus dispensing with the
wooden case that was normally
provided by the manufacturer.

Through the generosity of James
Jenkinson Bibby of Sansaw Hall and
Thomas Meares of Clive Hall, the
total refurbishment of the church
had cost £5,000 equivalent to
£460,000 today]. The estimate,
addressed to T. Meares Esq., Clive
Hall, Shrewsbury from Henry Willis
& Sons to supply the organ, was
