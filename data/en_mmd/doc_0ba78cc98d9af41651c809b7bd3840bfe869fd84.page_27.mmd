“anyone who has paid attention to public discourse about polities or other matters of policy can

easily atest. Yet thee is room for optimism,

least in the pereeptual realm, even though

perception---perceptual belie; anyhow-~is clearly cognitively penetrable,

4. Conclusion

Perceptual systems might well be modular without being F-modular, ie, without satisfying

Fodor's st

+ eriteria for modularity. In particular, there is nothing incoherent about

uunencapsulated modules. The co,

ive penetrability of perceptual modules has little direct

epistemological consequen

as the penetration ther epistemically advantageous or

pernicious, depen

ing on the details ofthe case. To the extent that perceptual modules have or

approximate F-modulaity, itis

tospective opacity that threatens to render perceptual errors

penetrability.”
