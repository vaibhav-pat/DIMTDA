MAN
Well... Tell your pop I said, “Thank you.”

BARTENDER
You never have to thank that man in your life. G-d, I
could kiss ya.
(After a moment, the MAN
takes the hat off and lowers
his collar. He sips the drink.)
Wow. You were younger in °09.

MAN
You know, everyone was.
BARTENDER
Yea, but... Weren’t you, what, in your late teens?
MAN
Not—exactly.
BARTENDER
How old are you right now?
MAN
... Sixteen.
BARTENDER

(Laughs, then abruptly
realizes and stops.)
Oh, you're not kidding. Is it cuz of your powers?
