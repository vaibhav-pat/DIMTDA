ii, Policy Changes: DD can be used asthe frst stage (insteument is Post x
Treated) and then you can control for Post and Treated in second stage.
1. Schoo! Program implementation (Duflo 2000): Implementation of
‘school program in some regions but not others produces an increase
in schooling (rst stage, this is used to estimate the effect of
schooling on wages (second stage).
2. Clean Air Act (Chay, Dobkin, and Greenstone 2003): Clean air at
binds for some states and not others in 1970, This leads toa
‘eduction in air pollution in those states (first stage) whichis used to
«estimate the effect of sr pollution on mortality (second stage)

)- Common Internal Validity Threats
‘© Bias can be magnified, 1 instrument isnot rly exogenous, even if the bias ofthe
reduced form is similar to OLS, the bias ofthe IV wll be made much large since the
denominator i less than 1

‘+ Randomly assigned instruments are not necessarily valid, If the instrument has a
dlect effet on the outcome (not through the treatment variable), then IV wil be
biased (Exclusion Restriction).
1. Egg. Ifa low draft number led people to stay in college to evade the daft, this
‘would bea

eo elfect on earings (not through military service).

4) Other Problems
‘©The LATE estimate is “loca” in that you ar only finding the treatment effect on the
group that is affected by the instrument (the “complirs"). If they look different than
the rest ofthe population, then the effects of providing a treatment tothe rest of the
population may look very different fom the LATE,

‘+ Leverages a situation where exposure to treatment varies discontinuously ata cutoff
for threshold value in a continuous assignment variable (sometimes called running
-variable). Examples include:

iL (eg. student test score, % free or reduced lunch eligible students a a school,
percent voting fora given party, ct).

“© Compares individuals (or other units like schools or firms) just above and just below
the cutoff in the assignment variable,
