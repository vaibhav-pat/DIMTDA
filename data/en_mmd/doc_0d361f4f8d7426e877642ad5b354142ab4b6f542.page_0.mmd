Enfield Methodist Circu

This short act of worship has been prepared for you by Revd
Valentin Dedji. We invite you to spend a few moments with
God, knowing that other people are sharing this act of worship
with you.

Welcome and Invocation:

Greetings to you all. We meet in the name of God the Father,
God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. Amen!

| warmly welcome you in my back garden. Whenever | am
here, gardening, | do feel God’s presence with me. Specially
that | believe that through gardening, | connect with God’s
creation.

Likewise, | strongly believe that, wherever you are listening to
me from now, God is with you. This has inspired me to choose
our first hymn entitled: ‘As we are gathered, Jesus is here’.

Joined by the Spirit, washed in the blood,

Part of the body, the Church of God.
As we are gathered, Jesus is here;
One with each other, Jesus is here.

Prayers of Adoration: (adapted from StF 25)

(© Heavenly Father, you are here with us!
‘As we your people meet to offer praise and prayer,
may we find in fuller measure

what itis in Christ we share.

Here, as in the world around us,

all our varied skills and arts

focussed on the work of the Holy Spirit

into open minds and hearts.

Lord of all, of Church and Kingdom,
in an age of change and doubt,
keep us faithful to the gospel,

help us work your purpose out.
Here, in this day's dedication,

all we have to give, receive:

‘we, who cannot live without you,
we adore you! We believe! Amen!
