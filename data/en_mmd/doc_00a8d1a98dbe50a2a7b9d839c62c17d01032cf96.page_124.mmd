li, SecTION 146(6) ~ ExcLUSION oF EVIDENCE

‘Subsection 146(6) is a saving provision that allows for statements obtained in
contravention of s. 146(2) to be admitted in a proceeding against a youth accused
in certain circumstances. Subsection 146(6) of the YCJA is therefore analogous to
's.24(2) of the Charter

However, there are two key differences between s. 146(6) and s. 24(2). First, under
'. 24(2), the effects of admission of the evidence on the administration of justice
‘as a whole are considered. In contrast, under s. 146(2), the question is whether
admission would bring into disrepute the principle that young persons are entitled
to enhanced procedural protections to ensure fair treatment and protection of
rights. Second, reliance on s. 146(6) is constrained to circumstances where the
violation of s. 146(2) amounted to a ‘technical irregularity”. Where the violation is
more serious, s. 146(6) is unavailable. In contrast, there is no such limitation in s
242)

‘Therefore, judicial discretion to rely on s. 146(6) to admit a statement obtained in
contravention of 146(2) is significantly confined, reflecting the need to vigorously
‘guard against the diminishment of the protections provided by s. 146(2) and the
need for fair treatment for young persons: : R v NB, 2018 ONCA 556 at paras 149-

C, JUDICIAL INTERIM RELEASE

Section $3(8) of he YCJA confers exclusive jurisdiction upon “a youth justice court
judge" to release a young person charged with an offence referred to in S. 522 of,
the Criminal Code, which incorporates s. 469 offences, from custody. The
jurisdiction to hear such applications is concurrent as between Superior Court
judges sitting as Youth Court judges, and Youth Court judges, even after an
accused elects to be tried in the Superior Court: A v TUM, 2021 SCC 6
