How isthe spruce | 1] Understory plant cover |» Total vegetation cover decreased in salvage Short-term outcomes af sahage treatments demonstrated an

increased in the amount of fine fuels and decreased total
vegetation cover. The decrease in vegetative cover was 3
result of lower shrub cover. Exotic species cover was low and
similar among salvaged and non-salvaged areas Increases in
fine fuels were evident in the salvage units, but values stil are
Within normal ranges.

\We expect over the long-term, vegetation will recover due to
increased light availabilty and other resources. However, we
donot know how understory plant cover and composition
will shife.Longer-term monitoring ofthese sites will help
Understand this change.
