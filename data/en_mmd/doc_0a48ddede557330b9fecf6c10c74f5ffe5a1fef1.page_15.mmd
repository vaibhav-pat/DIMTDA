Visit the Michigan Voter Information
Center michigan.gov/vote and enter
your address to find the information for
your city or township clerk.

If your city or township clerk operates a
satellite office or offices, the hours and
locations of those offices will be posted
as well.

Alternatively, you can call your city or
township clerk’s office and ask for their
hours and location. City and township
clerks’ offices must be open during their
normal hours, for at least 8 hours the
weekend before each election (July
31st-August 1st for the primary and
October 30th-31st for the general
election), and from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on
Election Day (August 3rd for the primary
and November 2nd for the general
election).

Is my clerk’s office accessible?
