3. RECONTEXTUALIZATION OR REMOVAL: A BALANCING TEST

Thave argued that honorific representations cun be morally objectionable for a host of|

san take at

‘strong presumption in favor of modification, But modiicat

least two forms: making them inaccessible to the public, or recontextualizing them. T argue i

this seetion that whether we ought to opt for one or the other option isa function of at least ten

moral and pragmatic factors. I develop an account of how these factors ought to be weighed, and

I defend this “balancing” approach against a

umber of objections

First, let me say a bit more about how Idefine the two modifiat

tions. “Removing

econtextualization” refers to the act of commenting upon a semantic object by

‘object’s meanings withthe aim of making that meaning another person's primary interpretation

of the object. To generate a me

heretofore part ofits public meaning. It seems clea that recontextualization can only directly

influence public me
