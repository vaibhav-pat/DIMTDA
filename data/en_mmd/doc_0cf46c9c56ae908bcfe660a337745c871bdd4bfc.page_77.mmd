Focused Discussions with Families

Purpose

Focused discussions with family members
are an effective tool for schools for
‘gathering feedback and input into school
decisions and planning. Schools can use
focused discussions to gather information
(qualitative data) to more fully understand
parent and caregiver perspectives.
Focused discussions are helpful for
‘explaining and expanding the results of
surveys. They are also inexpensive and
quickly implemented. The focused
discussion guidelines presented in this,
document are less formal than some
focus group protocols that are strictly
implemented and contribute to research.
‘These focused discussion guidelines
should be considered guidance for
hosting focused discussions with adult
family members or caregivers about
home-school partnerships that suppor
early literacy.

Selecting a Facilitator &
Participants

Participants should represent the families
served by the school. Consider including
{grandparents who are raising children,
fathers, foster families, families of children
receiving Special Education services, and
{families with a range of incomes. When a
deeper understanding of one subgroup is
desired, such as families of exceptional
students, a focused discussion of
members from that group should be
convened. Before the event, determine it
‘any participants will need an interpreter or
documents translated. Each focused
discussion should have about 6-12
parents or caregivers.

During the discussions, parents and
caregivers can build on and reflect on
each other's responses. No one.
participant should dominate the
discussion. The faciltator's role is to guide
the discussion back to the topic gently,
reminding participants of the purpose of
the discussion. Facilitators are neutral and
‘should not share their own opinions.
Facilitators can use reflection to clarify
what they hear, but should refrain from
‘speaking too much.
