‘tv0 volunteers prepare the cups forthe Gluey Paty
2. Shake the glue water mixture very well before using
3. Count the students and prepare a cup fr each student by pouring S0 mi of the glue(water solution
into the ziplock bag inside each of the 1D. cups.
4, Set these cups aide and pour 10 mL. of borax into the same numberof | oz. cups. Do-no add 199
‘much borax ~ it will make the glucy putty runny,
5. Another volunteer should put the following vocabulary words on the board:
Solid, liquid, gas, polymer, non-Newtonian

if this is not done, the gluey putty willbe

1. Introduction
"plastic bag containing
plastic Water bot with cap
dich bag
polyester sock (rotor polymer bled)

+ A\VSVS member should put the following vocabulary words onthe board:
solid, liquid, gas, polymer, non-Newtonian liquid

‘+ Make a chart onthe board to compare properties of liquids and solids
Ask students: What is the difference between solids, liquids, and gases?
Be sure to bring up the following points if they do not come up in the discussion
‘maintain their own shape; molecules are densely packed and move slowly.
© Liquids take the shape of the container; molecules are lose enough to maintain shape
‘but have more freedom to move.
© Gases fll the container; molecules have the greatest amount of movement (free to move
anywhere in th container).
© Have students brainstorm about properties ofeach, Write their responses on the board
‘under the appropriate headings.
‘Some answers ean be:

‘A Solid ALLiquid
Tas definite shape | has no definite shape
(lows and takes the
shape of a container)
an break into | does not break into

pivees pieces
Takes up a definite | takes up a det
space space

particles are | parleles are not

packed tightly | packed very tightly
together and | and move faster than
move slowl those in a solid

Tell the students that they will focus on solids and liquids and thei characteristics.

Modeling Solids, Liquids and Gases:
Use 8 student volunteers to demonstrate the propertics of solids, liquids, and gases. Ask the teacher to
help in selecting students who are willing to hold arms.
