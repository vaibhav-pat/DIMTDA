ate it; it was as sweet as honey in my mouth: yet as soon as I
had eaten it, my belly was bitter.”? — Revelation 10:9-10

Overview

Under the guise of discussing theorems concerning the inerrancy? of
Scripture, The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, hides an agenda
of Biblical Authority.* This statement wanders far afield from the topic
of inerrancy, including inspiration’, infallibility®, and a fallacious test of
orthodoxy’. When an afterthought of God is finally brought into the
picture, very insufficient lip service is given to the Spirit’, when we
should expect that a discussion of authority would begin with God.

ice, The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, is in all reality a
ission of authority, not of inerrancy, we begin our overview here.

di
Authority

So what is our chiefest and highest authority? There are several
opinions on this matter.

+ Our final authority is our self. Philosophically this is often termed,
“The Man Measure Theory:” because, in it, man is made the
measure of all things. We could see this as man in aggregate rather
than in self; yet, should I happen to believe this,” who is better to
determine this than me. This theory ultimately makes me god.
Those who press this theory for salvation, generally see themselves
as the source of salvation.

+ Our final authority is the aggregate human race.

+ Our final authority is a select group of leaders: for example, the
collegial agreement of all prelates; or the consensus of all
scientists, or the unanimous decision of a president, with his
cabinet, all of congress, and the system of courts; the vote of the
board of directors.

+ Our final authority is one leader: for example, one prelate,
scientist, president, sport star, movie star, or other idol.

+ Our final authority is the Bible.

+ Our final authority is tradition.
