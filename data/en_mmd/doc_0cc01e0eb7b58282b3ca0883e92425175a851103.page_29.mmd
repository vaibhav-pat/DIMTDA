(At lights: JAKUB, not
wearing his jacket, has just
cut a salami stick in quarters,
putting each quarter onto
newspaper and wrapping it.
LENA enters the room
silently, where JAKUB can’t
see her. She’s got on more
layers, fully camouflaging her
bump. She waits. JAKUB
sees her and jumps, holding
out the knife. Realizing it’s
LENA, he gasps and frowns.)

LENA
You gotta stop doing that; Nazis are loud.

JAKUB
You're still here! I figured since you hadn’t come
you'd been deported or—!

LENA
Shabbat shalom.

JAKUB
Shabbat shalom.
