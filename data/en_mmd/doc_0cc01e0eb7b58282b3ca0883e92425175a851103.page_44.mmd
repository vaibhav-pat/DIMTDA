MAN
Please just give it back!

BARTENDER
(Realizing.)
Oh, my G-d! Hold on! You’re Forever Boy!

(The MAN sighs, retracting
his arm.)

MAN
Can I please have it back?

BARTENDER
Have it back? Sir, ya drinks are free!
(The MAN frowns as the
BARTENDER returns the
LD., getting to making a Tom
Collins.)
Oh, my G-d. Oh, my G-d—I just... I just have to
thank you for everything you’ve done. Honestly.
Look, my pop was there in °09—when Doctor Canine
took the Brooklyn Bridge. If you hadn’t’ve showed
up... Look, my family owes you everything. My pop
actually went to the Times and fought for you to get
that Peace Prize last year, y’know?

(The BARTENDER provides
the Tom Collins.)
