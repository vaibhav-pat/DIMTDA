starting winding in a synchronous motor

‘The motor is connected to the network. But there is no current in the rotor winding. In
the starting winding of the rotor, an EMF is induced, the rotor starts to rotate.

When the three-phase armature winding is switched on into the network, a rotating
magnetic field is formed, which interacts with the current Ju in the starting winding
(Fig. 4.26), creates electromagnetic forces F and carries the rotor along. After the rotor ac~
celerates to a speed close to synchronous speed, the direct current that passes in the excita-
tion winding creates a synchronizing torque that pulls the rotor into synchronism,

When sliding s = 5%, a constant current flows into the rotor winding. The rotor follows,
the stator field and rotates with it synchronously. At the same time, there is no current in the
starting winding, because the stator field for the rotor has become constant,

But if the rotor starts to swing, the field becomes variable. In the starting winding of
the rotor, an EMF is induced, a current appears. The magnetic field of this current calm the
swings of the rotor.

‘Therefore, the starting winding is also called damper winding,

‘This method of launching is used most often.

‘To reverse the synchronous motor, you need to swap any two phases of the stator
winding,
‘Synchronous compensator
A synchronous compensator is a synchronous motor that operates only in idling mode.
Even he does not have a working end of the shaft. The synchronous compensator is designed
to regulate the reactive power that it gives or takes from the electrical network.
