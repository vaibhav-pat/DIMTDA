wearing face coverings, practicing socal
distancing and being so respectful ofthe

ur decisions have been guided by much
prayer and the recommendations and guidelines
Of the COVID Compass and Badger Bounce Back
Plan. If Vernon County is not at Severe Risk for
transmission of the Coronavirus and it dees nat
rain, we will continue to worship outdoors.

Every Wednesday at Noon the COVID Compass
is updated on the La Crosse County and Vernon
CCounty Health Department websites. We will
keep you updated each week via Facebook, our
website, and our Church Office voicemail of any
changes to our plans to worship outdoors.

We are currently holding two services on
Sunday momings at 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.
to provide more opportunities for worship and
social distancing and we have no plans to alter
four schedule. As we navigate these new
waters, though, we may discover that one
service on Sunday moring adequately meets
the needs of aur community or we may
experiment with an alternative worship time
during the week. We will keep you updated
with any changes in our worship schedule via
the newsletter, Coon Valley Lutheran Church
