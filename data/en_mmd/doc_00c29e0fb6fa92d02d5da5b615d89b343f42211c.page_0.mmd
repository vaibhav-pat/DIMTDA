Attn: Carrie Bradshaw

‘Subject: Salary Increase

Dear Carrie,
have been an employee of G.A.L. Corporation for 14 years. have proudly served as the head
‘accountant and made sure to meticulously watch the books. Ithas come to my attention that
‘my salary is not sufficient for the amount of work that | am required to do. Other positions with
my work load are paying an average of $56,000 a year, while | am brining home $35,000. know
that this company cannot pay me a salary ofthis amount, but lam requesting a 20 percent
increase on my salary. This would be $7,000 a year fora total package of $42,000.

In my tenure with the company, ! have helped through vigorous IRS audits and have always
passed any reviews with flying colors. | have trained more than 40 personnel for the accounting
‘department, most of who have gone on to bigger and better things. | have remained dedicated
to the firm, even when there was a complete split back in 2000 and entirely new administration
100k over. Dedication lke ths is not easy to find and therefore | feel my request is reasonable.

Inan effort to save money, can absorb the postion that the company has open for a part-time
‘accounting clerk. I can take over paying the bills in addition to my normal job duties. By
allowing me an increase of $7,000 per year and taking over an additional position, | feel that |
‘could also be helping the company out. With this arrangement, you won’t have to find a new
‘employee to train, and you will have my years of experience in another faucet of accounting. {
have paid the bills for years in times past and can absorb this in my current job without issue.

ook forward to speaking with you in person regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

Tamara Green
