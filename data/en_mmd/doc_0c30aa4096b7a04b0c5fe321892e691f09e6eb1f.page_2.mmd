C. Project Purpose
|. Business Problem

‘There are currently four human resources servicing offices located within the Herbert C.
Hoover Building (HCHB)'. These four offices service approximately 3500 federal
‘employees. Under the Optimal Services Delivery Initiative it was decided to combine ITA,
(OS and EDA'S HR servicing offices into one, ereating a one-stop service center for all HR
services to HCHB building occupants, serviced by these three HR offices, except for political
appointees, staff assigned to the Secretary's Immediate Orie, and the IG’s office. The
‘overall intent is to decrease the number of HR servicing offices housed in HCHB, improve
efficiencies, and increase the quality of customer service. Specific organizational design,
servicing ratios, cost per full-time equivalent, and lines of authority and reporting are to be
determined.
