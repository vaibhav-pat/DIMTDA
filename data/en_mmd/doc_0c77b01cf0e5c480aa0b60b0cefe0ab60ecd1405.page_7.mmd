the actual world it would exist, simply because given the operation of time and chance it must exist,

To put it another way, given an actually elapsed endless run of events or states of affairs in the

‘actual world, it is metaphysically necessary that whatever is metaphysically possible should
actually occur or obtain at some point or other in that actually elapsed, endless run of events or

states-of affairs.

I don’t know if the foregoing line of reasoning is sound or not, (7) P've certainly heard it

‘often enough, asserted with an air of great assurance by critics of religious belief. Nevertheless,

Will not critically examine this line of reasoning here. Instead, 1 will simply limit myself to
applying this line of reasoning to the Tertia Via in order to fill the lacuna in the argument as

nslated above. The reader will recall that the lacuna is this: Aquinas assert tha ifthe physical

universe (and so, in this ease, the actual world) is composed solely of existentially

beings, then it could have gone out of existence in the past, and that if that had happened, nothing
would have existed now, something clearly contrary to fact. The missing piece seems to be: just
because it could have gone out of existence in the past, why suppose that it would have done so,

let alone that it must have done so, as Aqui

‘The foregoing line of reasoning answers that question. Let's suppose, as many atheists

then so to0 would the actual world, since it is constituted solely and wholly by whatever physical
universe happens to exist at that moment and so would eease to exist if that universe, or any of
