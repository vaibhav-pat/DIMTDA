DIANA
Of course, you were crowned with laurel in the
beginning, your gold hair was wreathed with laurel—

DIANA pulls another pill bottle out of her
purse; TENN grabs it. WARHOL hisses into
TENN’s ear, driving him the opposite way
from DIANA.

TENNESSEE
STOP! Frankie—help me!
WARHOL
I don’t need to look like him—I look like me!
DIANA

(another pill bottle)—but the gold is thinning and the
laurel has withered—

TENNESSEE
(running to her; grabbing it) STOP! FRANKIE!
HELP!

DIANA
Out of the passion and torment of my existence—

WARHOL
And I paint him—How many times do I need to paint
him?
