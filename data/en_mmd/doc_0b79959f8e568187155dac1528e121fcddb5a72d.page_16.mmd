sensory apparatus, rather than from any elaborated representation of an object having speci

perceptual properties.

Our approach opens the intriguing possibility that field

ced with

‘organization is sufficient for the minimal form of perceptual constancy

spatiotemporal c

ity, and that this mimimal form of perceptual co

taney may oceur

without rch representation of object properties.

Conclusions
To conclude, we have argued that some somatosensory spatial perceptual capacity

may be based on sl

pace, rather than on the more familiar frames of reference defined by

body parts, by orienting movements, or by stimulus location in external egocen

ie space. We

do

«deny that tactile information can be, and most frequently is, transformed into external
spatial coordinates. However, the core features of spatial perception may be found already in

the array of RFS in the sb

a. If correct, our position has several inter

ting perceptual

ing stimuli on the

consequences. First, it emphasises the strong isomorphism between percei

receptor surface, and perceiving one’s location in the

ironment during navigation, Second,

it replaces the motorie solution to the local sign problem with a physics-based solution,

teflecting learning about spatial adjacency through natural statisties of environmental motion.
‘Third, it implies the existence of a “tactile field” (Martin, 1992) that does not depend on the

body as either volumettic obj

oF locus of orienting movements. It would seem fruitful 10
‘consider whether the spatial perceptual capacity that we have considered for skin might apply

to other receptor surfaces, notably the retina
