‘Pre- and post-outbreak spruce establishment isnot related to elevation.
145% of post-outbreak seedling establishment can be explained by 1) ste moisture
(lower total solar exposure at landscape scale, and increased moisture retaining

features liter, moss at fine scales), and 2) increased regeneration in response to
increased canopy mortality
\We also found a significant pulse of regeneration in 2015 that i associated withthe
record-setting cool, wet spring and summer ofthat year.

‘© Elevation isa poor guide to predicting the future of|
spruce on the GUMG landscape in the context of the
‘combined impacts of spruce beetle and climate
change.

‘Identifying the influence of salvage on spruce is more
ifficult than just taking into account elevational
influences on temperature

‘Identifying species to replant folowing salvage
should take inta account other topographic variables
instead of elevation. Specifically, replanting spruce on
lower-elevation sites with moderately steep north-
facing aspects ikely tobe successful and help
‘maintain spruce on the landscape in an era in which it
Is projected to see significant deines in extent.
