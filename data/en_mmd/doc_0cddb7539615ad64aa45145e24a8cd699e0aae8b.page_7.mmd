Metis people were adept at travelling
inthe Canadian wilderness, They used
snowshoes in winter, canoe in spring,
‘Summer and Fall and used a Red River
Cart to transport furs to trading posts

Used to transport furs and other
goods to the trading posts the Red
River Cart was made entirely from
wood

They did not use grease on the axle so
the Red River Carts had a distinctive
‘squeaking sound as they travelled
across the prairies

When encountering streams and rivers
along their journey, the Metis people
could pull the pin out of the wheel,
remove the wheels, place them under
the cart and float the cart across the
water.
