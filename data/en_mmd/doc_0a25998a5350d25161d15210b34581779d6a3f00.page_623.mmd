[my commen the micro-EW and the macto-EW]

exactly my EDWs!!!!10"

78-9 That high-level statistical outcome is robust and invariant against the
details of the substrate and the microscopic laws

governing the flips and bounces; the high-level outcome is insulated and
sealed off from the microscopic level. It is a fact in its own right, at its own
level.

‘That is what it means to say that although what happens on the lower

on the higher level, it is nonetheles

level is responsible for what happet

irrelevant to the higher level. The higher level can blithely ignore the
processes on the lower level. As I put it in Chapter 2, “Our existence as
animals whose perception is limited to the world of everyday macroscopic
objects forces us, quite obviously, to function without any reference to
entities and processes at microscopic levels. No one really knew the
slightest thing about atoms until only about a hundred years ago, and yet
people got along perfectly well.”

[my comments: exactly one of my principles from my article 2005 which
reflects the relationship between the EDWs: one does not exist for the other.
Here in the above paragraphs it is exactly the same idea!!!111!]

781 am not suggesting that the invisible, swarming, chaotic, microscopic
level of the world can be totally swept under the rug and forgotten.
Although in many circumstances we rely on the familiar macroworld to be
completely predictable to us, there are many other circumstances where we
are very aware of not being able to predict what will happen.

[my comments: we have here exactly the EDWs: the micro-EW and the macro-EW!!]

[my comment: Reading H's book I realize itis more supreficial than Zizek's book!!! itis like
literature for newspapers for large publie!! About the self and his “loop” many statements I
understand them, .but mote exactly [have no patience to read them!]

112 In short, there are surprising new structures that looping gives rise to that
constitute a new level of reality that could “a principle be deduced from
the

basic loop and its detailed properties, but that “a practice have a different
