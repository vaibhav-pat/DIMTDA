children seem fine at the time, then it's afterwards you notice that the
impact seems to hit them.

+ Be Prepared

Bel

Preparation is key. For example, if they're starting a new nursery, practising
the journey there and back and talking about what they will have for lunch
will help them know what to expect.

Photos and pictures can be really useful for young children â€” things like
making a timeline of a house move with pictures of their old house and new
house and the sequence in which things will happen, then sticking it up on
their wall, so that they can have a visual reminder of what is going to
happen when.

With a child who is worrying about a change of teacher, remind them of the
things that are staying the same e.g. the same classroom, the same
teaching assistants, the same peers. If your child is in KS2 this will allow
them to have experience of change in preparation of secondary school.
