Starbucks
Head Chef Level Sponsor
Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of

Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was here where
Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted
coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for
our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by
the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradi-
tion of the early coffee traders. Ten years later, we would
grow to welcome millions of customers each week and
become a part of the fabric of tens of thousands of neigh-
borhoods all around the world. In everything we do, we
are always dedicated to Our Mission: to inspire and nur-
ture the human spirit - one person, one cup, and one

neighborhood at a time.
