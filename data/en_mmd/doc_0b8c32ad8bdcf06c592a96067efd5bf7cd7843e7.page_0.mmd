Feeders & Antennas (MWOJWP)
Key points:

+ Identify and recall the use of coaxial and twin feeders

+ Know that in coaxial cable the RF field only exits within the cable and is
not affected by objects outside the cable.

+ Know that feeders cause loss of signal strength on both transmit and
receive, The longer the cable, the greater the loss,

+ Know that twin feeder usually has lower loss that coaxial cable.

+ Know that loss is measured in dB

+ Know how to calculate the power delivered to an antenna for a given RF
output and given feeder loss (in multiples of 3 48)

+ 5b Feeder characteristic impedance

+ Know that the term ‘impedance’ can be thought of as a form of AC
resistance.

+ Know that feeders have a characteristic impedance which depends upon
‘the diameter and spacing of the conductors and those commonly available.

+ Know that an antenna has a feed point impedance which is determined by
‘the relative RF potential difference and current at that point

+ Know that the impedance of an antenna depends upon its dimensions
related to the wavelength of the applied signa

+ Know that an antenna will only present the correct impedance when fed
with the frequency for which it is designed, and that a half-wave dipole
has a feed point impedance of approximately 50 ohms when used at its
designed frequency,

+ Know that if the impedance of the antenna does not match the impedance
of the feeder, then some energy will be reflected back down the feeder
and that the proportion reflected will depend upon the degree of
mismatch

+ Know that the signal reflected back down the feeder is not lost but will
combine with the waves travelling up the feeder from the transmitter.

+ Know about the formation of standing waves.

+ Know that standing waves will affect the impedance presented to the
‘transmitter causing a mismatch between the transmitter and the
feeder.5e Antenna tuning unit

+ Know that a transmitter is designed to transfer energy into a specific
impedance
