6. By the number of windings per phase: with one winding, with two windings or
with three windings.

‘Transformers with one winding per phase are autotransformers.

‘They are used to connect power transmission lines with different voltages. For example,
it is 110 KV and 220 kV.

‘The transformation ratio of the autotransformer should be no more than 2-2.3
In addition, the small autotransformers are used in laboratories for regulation of volt-

age.

In its turn, the transformers with three windings per phase are:

—With one primary winding and two secondary windings for different voltages. (These
are transformers with three windings namely);

— With one primary winding and two secondary wi
transformers with split windings).
