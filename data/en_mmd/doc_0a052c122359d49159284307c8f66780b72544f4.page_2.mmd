‘The reason why the KwaZulu Natal Department of Health is paying the Chief
Director: IDMTS on salary level 16 is because an offer of employment was made
to him, by the Development Bank of South Attica, on a salary package which fell
within ‘salary level 16 in the Public Service. In order to retain his services, @
counter-offer was made by the department on the nearest higher salary package
compared to the offer received.

‘The Chief Director in the Gauteng Department of Economic Development, paid
cn salary level 16, was appointed as the Chief Executive Oificer (CEO) of the
Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site and Dinokeng Projects on 1 January
2022. This was done in accordance with the approved organisational and salary
structure below:

‘The appointments of heads of departments on salary level 15 and others on
salary level 16 is based on the service delivery model of the departments.
Furthermore, the size of the departments is also taken into consideration,
including client group, geographical distribution and the availablity of funds
within the Department. As a result, the upgrading of the Head of the Department
leads to the upgrading of the lower level posts including the performer level and
such leads to an increase in the compensation of employees (CoE), hence the
discrepancies of salary levels.
