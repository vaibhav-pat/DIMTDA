According to the Ra’avya, there is no particular reason to recite the entire verse,
since this is a blessing on the concept of keriat Shema, and not on its actual
recitation. But according to the Shibole/ Ha-leket, we are recreating an actual
recitation of the Shema ~ in secret ~ that was once a necessary part of the daily
service, so it does make sense that the Shema ~ at least the entire first verse, if not
more ~ be recited now as well

‘There is an important distinction between the Ra‘avya and the Shibolei Ha-
leket regarding the meaning of the concluding blessing. According to the Ra’avya,
“who sanctifies His name in public” refers to the present, where the Jewish people
recite the Shema in the synagogue. According to the Shibolei Ha-leket, however, the
concluding blessing is an implied prayer. The Jews are sanctifying God's name in
secret, which is a marvelous exhibition of perseverance and steadfastness ~ and
therefore we pray for the day when this sanctification can be public. The previous
line should be understood as follows: Sanctify Your name (in public) over those who
sanctify Your name (in private), and sanetify Your name in Your world (forall to see).
‘The secret sanctification is, alter all, deficient, and therefore we pray and look
forward to the day when God wil bring about the public, uninhibited sanctification of
His name.

‘According to both versions of the origin of Le-olam Yehei Adam, the prayer
‘expresses the unique role of the Jewish people in the world: They are the basis for
the sanctification of God's name. The congregation of those who declare the Shema
are literally upholding God's name in a world in which it would otherwise be absent.
This is a marvelous prayer, and | think it would be a shame if the exigencies of
modern life led us to skip it It is a wonderful way to begin one's prayer, to actually
understand the cosmic significance of what itis we are doing when we gather to pray.
