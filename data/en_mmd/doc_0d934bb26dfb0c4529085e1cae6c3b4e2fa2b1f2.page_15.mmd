We will set aside £5,000 of funding for your
organisation as part of this programme.

You'll get:

An instant grant of £2,000 to kick-start recovery
efforts and support you to put into practice new ideas
and initiatives.

Plus, up to £3,000 grant that pound-for-pound
matches an increase in income from trading. This is an
incentivised* grant to accelerate recovery and growth.
This element of the grant will be paid in instalments on
a quarterly basis and will be matched against an
increase in trading. The increase will be measured
against a baseline that we will set with you. For some
organisations who have struggled with trading due to
the Covid-19 crisis, this baseline may be zero.

*The incentivised grant is distributed in a similar way
to Match Trading grants.

grants here.
