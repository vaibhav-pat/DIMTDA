Dear [Hiring Manager Name],

‘When the senior account manager at Abernathy Tech challenged me to raise customer
satisfaction by 20% in one year, | didnt think we could do it. The problem was our
inefficient requirements-gathering process. It was a dream come true when | managed
to realize a 35% customer satisfaction boost. My skils in relationship-building, problem
solving, and HubSpot made it possible.

‘That's just one of the reasons I'm so excited about the account manager position at
KOM Systems. | know you need an account manager skilled in requirements gathering,
‘customer communication, and negotiating with vendors to save costs. This position fits
my skills, such as:
+ Requirements gathering. Worked with § cross-functional teams to raise
customer satisfaction through improved requirements-gathering procedure.
+ Customer communication. Slashed customer complaints through better
‘communication at all stages of development.
+ Negotiated with vendors to pass a 20% cost savings to our customers,
contributing to 35% customer satisfaction gain,

I'm excited to speak with you about how my skill in relationship-building, teamwork,
and problem-solving can help KOM's bottom line.

Best regards,
