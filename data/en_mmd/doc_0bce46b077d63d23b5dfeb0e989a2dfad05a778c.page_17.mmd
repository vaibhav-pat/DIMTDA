Yeah. Can share another moment that made me very uncomfortable in this documentary?
Which is the part where they're taking about Nana Visitor and Marc Alaimo. And they're, you
‘know, they're going back and forth between Marc Alaimo talking about you know him maybe not
{getting enough encouragement. And there's some weird kind of awkward moments inthis
documentary, where it seems like the filmmakers are lke judging the interviewees? And that's
‘one where you know he's going on this thing about lke "I didn't get enough encouragement” and
Ira goes back and he's lke "Well we kept having you back. That's how we give actors
encouragement" and they lke, show Marc Alaimo's face and there's this kind of Ike circus
music that's almost ike you know:

GRACE:
Waka wakka!

SUE:
Yeah,

JARRAH:
‘Yeah, but there's this whole thing where Nana Visitor talks about how like one of the ime she
was the most upset was when Ira said that in the next episode they were gonna write that she
and Dukat Ike, fall in love with each other and they have a thing. And Nana is being inteviewed
and she is Ike, very upset about ths thing and she slips up and goes like "Anybody except Marc
‘Alaimo. | mean anybody except Gul Dukat" And like everyone's laughing that i's like a sip, and
then they cut to Marc Alaimo and he's saying ike “Oh well ike of course he wanted her. | mean,

| know that because J wanted her” and then they are playing that for Nana. “Grace makes
uncomfortable noise" And she was lke rolling her eyes super uncomfortably. Because what are
you supposed to say? Like "Yeah no that's sexual harassment.” Like that was obvious and it
was sexual harassment, Because this is ike supposed to be a loving documentary about this
‘show they were all on, and it just kindof lke it was lke I guess: | don't know. | just felt ike it was
insensitive to put her in that position, and it was gross to play that moment for humor because
that isnt cool

GRACE:
Even in the making-of documentary of the show, we get to See behind the scenes how much the
‘show could have benefited from having some more women behind the scenes. Which is meta
and depressing

SUE:
They made a lt of choices to include lke sip-ups, oF jokes, or things that they-

JARRAH:
arent sure about?

SUE:
