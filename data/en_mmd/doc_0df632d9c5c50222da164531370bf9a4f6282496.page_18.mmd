removal, scrubbing to remove dirt, and extraction of propane, butane,
etc, may be all that is required. Oil must be pumped, distillation is more
complex, and cat cracking may be involved. After natural gas and oil
are depleted the energy load will fall upon coal. There is very little hope
that the world will awake in time to deal seriously with nuclear, wind,
solar or other, more sustainable, energy technologies: man is more like a
lemming, than like a wizard. When the coal is gone we will commence
to bum our forests to the ground.

Interestingly, we could find no data for undiscovered coal. Such
deposits must exist: but, they are most likely under our forests, which
will be destroyed when we mine the coal. We did find a crude area plot
from USGS, Bulletin 1450-B that paints a rough picture of undiscovered
coal deposits.”
