A The Dobbs decision held as follows: “The Constitution does not
confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the
authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their
elected representatives.” Thus, in the absence of any federal law
governing abortion, Ohio law now solely determines the legality and
of abortion. This places a new importance on the Ohio
court system, in particular the Ohio Supreme Court. While the
legislature has recently passed — and the governor signed — a
number of prolife bills, most of them remain stalled in the courts.
The most notable of these is the so-called Heartbeat Law (SB 23).
Even with favorable court rulings on these laws, the optimal
solution to banning abortion in Ohio is a constitutional amendment.
