The Only Real and True Authority

Not one of these opinions sees the final authority of the universe as
being exclusively from the Father proceeding only to the Son: so that, all
other authorities in heaven or on earth are subordinate to the Son, Jesus
Christ, and He alone determines what is done among angels and men.
Not one of these opinions sees the final power of the universe as being
exclusively from the Father proceeding only to the Spirit: so that, all
other powers in heaven or on earth are dependent upon the Spirit, and
He alone enforces the authority of the Son among angels and men.

All other authorities are delegated; all other powers are distributed
according to the will of God alone. This is not determinism: for God
wills both consequences and instruments or means. This is not a
rejection of the Truth of Scripture: for Scripture remains the principal
record, yet not the only record, of the Divine Authority and Power, as
well as how it is delegated or distributed

Organization
When the Holy Trinity directed Moses” path in the wilderness with all
the tribes of Israel, a great mixed multitude of around two million
people:

+ God provided for each of the thirteen tribes to select a patriarch as
their own tribal or family leader."

+ God appointed Moses to be the great prophet.'! Yet Moses has no
special place, except in the memory of the people of God.!?

+ God appointed the Israelites to be a kingdom of priests." Their
national task by God’s election was to administer the Law, which
they are about to receive.

+ God provided for each of the twelve tribes, excluding Levi, to
select six elders per tribe." These are lay offices."

+ God chose Aaron, a Levite, to be the first high priest.!® The high
priests are to be chosen from Aaron’s lineage. Ithamar, the
youngest of Aaron’s sons is appointed to head the Levites.”
