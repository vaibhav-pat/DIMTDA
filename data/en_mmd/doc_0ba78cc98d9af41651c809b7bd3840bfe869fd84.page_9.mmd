Fopok’s HEART RATE: Fodor once (1988) joked about his heart rate being cognitively
~penetrable” on the grounds that an intention to do calisthenics results in his doing

calisthenics, which results in increased heart ra

Heart rate obviously isn't psychological
‘phenomenon, but the general point is clear enough,

CCHANGEIN FIXATION: the same moral applies when the “penetrated” capacity really is
psychological I deliberately move my eyes, or turn around, thus alleing what I fixate on and
thus what Ise

(CHANGE IN ATTENTION: without movis

iy eyes, I change the locations or objects to which I

‘am devoting attention, which affects my visual experience (e.., the Necker eube shifts, or the

subject in the old woman/young woman drawing now looks like the young woman).
OCULOMOTOR EFFERENCE COPY: your eyes are paralyzed, but you try to move them to the left,

‘an apparent shift or relocation of the objects in your field of view (Kornmueller

1951, Whitham etal. 2011). Let's suppose that they way this works is thatthe intention causes
the motor areas to send not only a signal to the oculomotor muscles but also an effeence copy
to the visual system so thatthe visual system can update a post-retinotopic representation
ssecordingly. Ths the desire indirectly influences the postretinotopic representation and the
resulting visual experience.

EsFORT AND DISTANCE: subjects who intend to throw a heavy weight toa target judge the
distance to that target to be greater than do subjects who have no suc intention (Wit et al
2004). Suppose it works as follows: the intention to throw the weight causes an activation of

motor read

ss routines, where the readiness reflects the expected required effort. The visual

system takes the degree of readiness as a eue to distance, with the result that more effort
