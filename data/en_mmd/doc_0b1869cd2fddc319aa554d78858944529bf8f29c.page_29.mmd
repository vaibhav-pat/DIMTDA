5.1. Ensemble results

Its of interest o examine the results of the analysis aggregated by model generation ~ that i the
‘CMIPS and GMIPS model generations. The key diference between the two (aside trom improvements
in model parameterisations and resolution is thatthe CMIPS models were subjected toa dynamical
downscaling process (Figure 3.1). This process has significant impacts onthe resulting changes inthe
parameters. This is highlighted by the more tkely changes seen in all parameters fr the CMIP3
ensemble,
