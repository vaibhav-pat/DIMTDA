In preparing the ICIA, Ihave formed an opinion that our policy, strategy or service is NOT Ikely to have an effect on an island
community which is NOT significantly different from its effect on other communities (including other island communities). The
reason for this is detailed below.

Reason for not completing a full Islands Communities Impact Assessment

Aull impact assessment is not required as the proposal is unlikely to have an effect on an island community which is significantly
different from its effect on other communities (including other island communities).

‘As explained above, mitigations will continue to be provided to facilitate the use of paper submission, for example in situations
where applicants have no or insufficient broadband access for a defined period (48 hours or more).

No evidence has been presented as part of the consultation that indicated any unique island impacts that require to be taken into
account.
