FRANK
Tommy Williams...? Long time no see. What are you
doing in Cape Town?

TENNESSEE
(going to scrim room) You recognized me after years.
After only seeing me one time on a sand dune, my
face only lit by starlight. And you recognized it. Why
would you do that? (no response) Why didn’t you try
to reach me?

FRANK
Streetcar made you golden, and I’m not one for
hopping on bandwagons.

TENN kisses FRANK with force, surprising
him.

FRANK
Wow... I’ve been thinking about you since as well.
Glad that’s settled.

TENNESSEE
This... I can’t do it to you again. (no response) It'd
be very polite of you to stop looking at me like that;
it’s intoxicating and unfair. (no response) Do you
want to see a show with Bette Davis in it?
