Your Team

Your school's Partnerships for Literacy
team should be balanced. There
should be a balanced number of
teachers and parentsicaregivers, and a
balance of diversity that represents the
leachers and families of your school so
that your team can create the best plan
for your students. In many states,
schools are required to conduct a
language usage survey for every new
student upon registration and to have a
contact list of bilingual staff
interpreters! community liaisons that
correspond to the language survey
results. These individuals could
encourage participation from families
who might not otherwise step forward
to participate because of language
challenges.
