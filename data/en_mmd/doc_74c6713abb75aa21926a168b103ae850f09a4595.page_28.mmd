A.7 Vessel Draft

CCaris HIPS & SIPS uses a dolta draft filet interpolate changes in drat. However, frequent pumping of
ballast water to trim the vessel often makes this methodology unsustainable. For this reason GA uses
the more accurate GPS Tide methodology to correct for this

‘A.8 Dynamic Draft 'Squat' (Only as Required)

CCaris HIPS & SIPS cannot compute dynamic draft unless a drat table ie applied inthe “ht fe. A
dynamic daft table is available (see below) forthe AV Solanderin the “hv fle. The merge

In this example (AV Solander, no squat is applied until 5 knots and then progressively applied to a
