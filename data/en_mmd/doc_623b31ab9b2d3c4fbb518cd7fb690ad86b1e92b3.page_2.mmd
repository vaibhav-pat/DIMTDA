While it has been a difficult year, we are
ooking forward to a suecessful 2021.

‘So Won't You Consider ---

Giving an additional gift to our
organization. As you know, there is no
governmental funding, and financial
contributions are needed for day-to-day

including replacing the sills under the
house, creating a structure to house our
sawmill, reconstructing our Aermotor
‘windmill, and providing a building to
better serve the Quinnipiae Tribal
Museum. Matching funds are needed for
‘grant support.

Volunteering to assist in one of our
many projects or as a committee
member. There is much work to be

done. So far over 50 volunteers have
contributed more than 2000 hours of

time to the Foundation in 2019- valued
at more than $60,000!
