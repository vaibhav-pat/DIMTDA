TENNESSEE
You hate my favorite people.

KATHARINE
Who? Bette? You like her because you hate her—
I’ve read your work.

TENNESSEE
Why can’t you just die already?! G-d! I’m in a rush!
It’s yours!

KATHARINE
You surprise me.

KATHARINE exits.

DAVIS
In my presence you give Amanda to Katharine
Hep—?

TENNESSEE
I’m writing a play called Sweet Bird of Youth. (using
hand signals) Jimmy Farentino’s got the part if he
rides the D-Train right into Broadway.

DAVIS
I can perform tonight.

TENNESSEE
A thousand blessings.
