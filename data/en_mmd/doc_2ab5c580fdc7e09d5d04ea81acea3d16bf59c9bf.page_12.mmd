Proportional Reasoning involves comparing 2 ratios ax well as identifying equivalent ratios. There are many methods
‘of solving problems:

‘© Unit ratios (Unitizing) ~ Figure out the unit ratio

‘+ Scaling up or down — (If 3 dozen cost 24.99, what would 6 dozen cost? You could use unit
rate, but it would be easier to multiple the cost by 2. This is a build up or scale approach)
Scale factors ~ Comparing the scale and using that factor to calculate the answer.
Ratio tables
Double line comparison
Graphs
Cross products

All these methods are useful in particular situations and all should be understood. The fist three are the most
Intuitive, therefore the students might be able to discover them independenty. These probleme will allow them to
explore some ofthese strategies.

Have the students try to find 2 or 3 diferent methods for solving these problems
