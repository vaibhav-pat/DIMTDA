If you reduce the excitation current, then the EMF graph will go higher. This happens
because the flux of residual magnetism is added to the flux from the rotor current.

We cannot build this characteristic from the excita-
tion current equal to zero, because without the presence of
a certain value of the rotor flux, we cannot provide the
‘nominal value of the stator current.

Why do you think we have built three characteristics?
