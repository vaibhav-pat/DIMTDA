‘Studied scenarios

“The study analyzed four land management and two climate change scenatios from the Hadley
General Circulation Model (GCM). The land management scenarios considered were the
‘current farmers’ practice (hereafter called baseline) tillage and other three different tillage
practices (Table 2). One of the tillage builds on the baseline tillage and allows removal of
biomass from corn and soybean fields, which is practiced by some farmers. The other two
tillage scenarios are conservation tillage and conservation tage with cover crop using rye
grass, Conservation tillage isan agricultural practice that reduces soll disturbance and enhances
soll crop residue on the soil surface. The fourth scenario considers conservation tillage plus
‘cover crop with rye grass in periods where there was not crop production. Use of cover crop
lke rye grass is recommended to reduce soil erosion and nutrient loss from the soll
