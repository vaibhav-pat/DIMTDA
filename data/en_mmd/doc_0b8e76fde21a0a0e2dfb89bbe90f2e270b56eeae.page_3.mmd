addressed before further measures are introduced

‘The Ministry of Justice has responded positively to our recommendations and an
‘overarching evaluation of the impact of the court reform programme is underway.®
We further understand that HMCTS has commenced work on the collection of more
consistent, higher quality data on the protected characteristics of defendants,
including disability data.® While we welcome these steps, which are central to the
department's compliance with the PSED, we are concerned that the Bill provides for
a significant and permanent expansion of live link before the impact of existing
measures on disabled defendants is properly understood and an effective data
collection programme implemented.

Beyond the experience of disabled defendants, recent evidence suggests issues
may exist around the quality of lve link equipment: the impact of its use on
sentencing and levels of legal representation:"' and the effect of video appearances
on defendants’ ability o effectively participate in the criminal justice process. "®

‘The Commission advises the Government to implement the recommendations
of our Criminal Justice Inquiry before permanently expanding the use of live
link in criminal proceedings.
