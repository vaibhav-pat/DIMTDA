Exercises

1 First use of the RF measuring instruments

1.1 Generate an AM modulated signal using the RF signal generator with the following

parameters: carrier requency=1 MHz, power lavel=0 dsm, AM modulation with modulating
frequency=10 kHz and modulation index=10%.

1.2 Study the AM signal and its components (the modulating signal and the carrer inthe time
domain using the oscilloscope.

“Experience collected during the completion of the measurements. 1

1.3 Vary the RBW' (2 ifferent values: 1kHz/3kHiz), VBW- (2 different values: 30H2/300Hz) and
‘SPAN (as given: 100kH2) parameters of RF spectrum analyzer and study the spectrum of
[AM signal observed applying the different analyzer settings.
