June Bonsai Tips'

June and again in late August through September. A good treatment is to
spray with Mancozeb and Cleary 3336.

Black spot fungus can attack any plant with fleshy leaves if the conditions
are right. Deciduous Hollies, for example, can easily be infected. It begins
to develop in the spring when temperatures reach into the sixties and the
garden has been continuously wet for six to nine hours. By the time
temperatures reach into the seventies, the disease can be running
rampant. Treatments include baking soda, Neem oil and chemical
fungicides like Macozeb and Immunox. If you have seen this disease on
any of your bonsai in the past, spray those bonsai before the disease takes
hold.

Needle Cast is a broad group of diseases that affect the needles of
‘conifers. It is common fungal problem for pines, including Japanese
Black Pine and Ponderosa, as well as spruce trees. It shows up as a
discoloration or uneven browning of the needles. Michael Hagedorn
suggests spraying with Daconil or a copper fungicide when the new
needles are coming out. Also try Cleary 3336 systemic fungicide.

Spider mites are a common insect problem on evergreen bonsai such as
junipers, cypress and spruce. To test for their presence, simply shake
‘some foliage over a solid white sheet of paper; if you see tiny specks
moving around on the paper it's spider mites. If present, first pressure
spray all the foliage several times with the garden hose. If after a day or so,
spider mites are stil present, you can use Malathion or a less harsh
product like Neem oil or insecticidal soap.
