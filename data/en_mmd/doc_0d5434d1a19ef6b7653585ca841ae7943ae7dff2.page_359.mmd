and yelling something like, “They have guns. They're shooting. Get down.
They had come in the west door. Up to this point, she hadn't
noticed anything different.

She said that she looked to her left. Marlene was still with her,
Marlene said it looked like- someone had set off a smoke bomb. Suzanne
thought it was a smoke bomb, She thinks the smoke was white. She
saw the smoke in the senior parking lot from where she was standing
by the pillar,

Suzanne said that this all happened very fast. As soon as. she
and Marlene talked about the “smoke bomb", everyone was getting

under tables. Marlene and Suzanne and some kids, she doesn't know
who they were, were squatting down by the pillar they'd been
standing by. She said she was literally looking to the west for
someone to come through, not knowing they were on the other side of the

cafeteria. They were the shooters.

Suzanne stated that she heard gun shots. She has heard guns at

4 rifle range at summer camp. It didn’t sound like rapid machine
gun types ofa gun. It sounded like a shotgun, and was very loud,
The kids got up in mass and swarmed the stairs.hundreds of them.
She heard screaming and shooting.At about that point, Marlene and
Suzanne got up and ran to the kitchen through the door close to the
pillar where they were hiding. ‘They took some kids with them to the

kitchen. She thinks maybe five kids. She stood in the doorway of
the storeroom and yelled at kids tocome in to the storeroom. She
thought it may have been a senior prankat first. When it sounded

like the shooting was getting closer, the kids ran back and in to
the store room. Suzanne shut the door. After about a minute, she
‘opened the door abut an inch to peck out and there was smoke. The
cafeteria was filled with smoke. She thought it was white smoke,
When she peeked out, Marlene and some kids were hiding behind some
‘equipment in the kitchen.

She never saw the shooters.
