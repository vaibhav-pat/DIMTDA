Fig. 1. Ilustraton of the three primitive cognitive operations underlying the spatial
perception of the world, postulated by Jean Nicod (1924). A) The notion of succession refers
to the cumulative counting of successive movements and allows the learning of spatial
adjacency between A and B, B and C. B) The notion of resemblance refers to the ability 10
lear specific associations between locations and sensory qualities (e.g.. the location A is
associated with the sound “MI"). This concept is similar to the focal sign mechanism
proposed by Love (1884). C) Finally, the notion of direction allows the creature to perceive
the relation between one hop and the next: whether the second hop is a repetition or a reversal
of the frst.
