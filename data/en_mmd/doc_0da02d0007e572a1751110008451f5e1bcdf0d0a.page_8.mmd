Free Play

During a Free Play session the child is provided with materials and decides for
themselves how, where, with whom, when and what to play. Materials which are
made available include:

+ Books

+ Water Tray

+ Home Comer - kitchen, shop, t-sets, groceries, dolls, prams etc.

+ Cars, train sets

+ Animal sets

+ Blocks made from various materials including wood, metal, cardboard and
plastic (Lego, stickle bricks)

Children in a free play session are made aware of where materials can be found. All
toys are stored on low easily-accessible shelves and children are free to play with
whatever materials they choose.

The role of the adults present isto:

+ Ensure that materials are provided which will engage the child in a meaningful
way.

+ Provide progression in their learning by adding materials when appropriate.

+ Ask meaningful question without interfering in the child's own learning
process.

+ Ensure that materials are age appropriate.

+ Supervise the play in a non-intrusive way.

+ Encourage the children by responding to questions and praising work
