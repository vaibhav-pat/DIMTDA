(Huntington Beach, CA, January 23, 2018) Kitchen and bath design aficionados

2019. In tune with the growing wave of homeowners pursuing a warmer, homier
look at the kitchen sink, California Faucets presents its most distinctive lineup of
classic brass finishes yet. Made with materials reflecting the quality of yesteryear
in styles that maintain a modem flair, the brass finishes range from Satin Brass,
with its eye-catching bling, to the more rustic Burnished Brass.
