Opening Song: Come, Ye Thankful People, Come

‘Come, ye thankful people, come For the Lord our God shall come
Ralse the song of harvest home {And shall take the harvest home
Allis safely gathered in From the field shall in that day
Ere the winter storms begin Alloffences purge away

God our maker doth provide Giving angels charge at last

For our wants to be supplied In the fire the tares to cast

Come to God's own temple, come But the fruitful ears to store
Ralse the song of harvest home In the garner evermore

All the world is God's own field Even so, Lord, quickly come

Fruit as praise to God we yield Bring Thy final harvest home
‘Wheat and tares together sown Gather Thou Thy people in
{Are to joy or sorrow grown Free from sorrow, free from sin
First the blade and then the ear There forever purified

Then the full corn shall appear In Thy presence to abide

Lord of harvest, grant that we Come with all Thine angels, come
‘Wholesome grain and pure may be Raise the glorious harvest home

‘The Gathering of the Community
