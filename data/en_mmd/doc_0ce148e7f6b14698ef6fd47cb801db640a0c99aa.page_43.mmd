doing so, we can explore the processes in the machine with simple laws, with the help of
the laws of Kirchhoff and Ohm.

‘The next type of losses are the mechanical losses. There are the losses from friction in
bearings and friction of the rotor about the air that arise when it rotates. Typically, the me-

Magnetic losses in the rotor we neglect, because the frequency of magnetization rever-

‘Therefore, these losses are so small that they are usually neglected.

At the end of the calculations, additional losses are added Pass. T
