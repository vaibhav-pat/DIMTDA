TRANSPORTATION - Getting around is a major
roadblock to the blind and visually impaired. Consumers
are offered free transportation to work, doctor's
appointments, shopping, and group activities. Limited

vision no longer means limited transportation.

ORIENTATION & MOBILITY — O&M’s goal is to train
consumers with techniques of safe, efficient travel both
in the home and into the community. Skills are taught
that are vital for independence, confidence and self-
satisfaction. Instruction is built around the goals and

needs of the student.
