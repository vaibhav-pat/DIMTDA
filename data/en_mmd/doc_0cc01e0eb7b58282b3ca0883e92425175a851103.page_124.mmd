ROSE
You don’t think I know that? Of course you’ll be
back; you're obsessed with me. You’d never leave
me alone with the Wicked Witch longer than I can
handle her. And I can handle her for a long time. (off
his reaction) Go to your train, you big crybaby. I'll
always be here.

TENN hugs her.

ROSE
Yes, yes, you’re so very blubbery.
TENNESSEE
I don’t remember if this is the last time I saw you like
this...

ROSE
Dearest, you’re drunk. (hugging him back for a few
moments) I believe we're suffocating Antoine. (they
release) Don’t worry. I’ll be here, Tomcat.

TENN taps his temple in agreement.
Blackout on ROSE.

EDWINA
What happened to her?
