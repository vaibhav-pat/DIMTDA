called upon to adjudicate on her role in any alleged misconduct. Nor had the trial
judge been previously called upon to consider the accused's conduct or her
credibility or reliability as a witness.

‘The situation may, however, have been different if the accomplice would testify as
‘a defence at the accused's trial and the trial judge would be required to make
credibility findings in respect of that witness, because the trial judge had previously
‘opined on the witness’ credibility: R v Slatter, 2018 ONCA 962, at paras 16-18

In Locknik, the Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's ruling that no reasonable
‘apprehension of bias attached to a justice who granted dial recorder warrants. The
justice wrote to the affiant requesting additional information and clarifications. The
Court agreed that, in doing so, the justice was seeking facts relevant to the justice's
assessment of the reliabilly of the information: 2019 ONCA 625, at paras 31-39

In Chambers, the trial judge's reasons for conviction gave rise to a reasonable
‘apprehension of bias through animated and unrelenting criticism and sarcasm
towards the evidence of the appellant and the conduct of the defence. The reasons
gave rise to concerns regarding a loss of perspective and objectivity: Rv
‘Chambers, 2019 ONCA 738

In Ibrahim, the Court of Appeal dismissed an allegation of bias but found that the
trial judge conducted the mistrial application in an injudicious manner by making
numerous unfounded allegations against defence counsel, raising none of them
with counsel atthe time, and then not affording counsel the opportunity to respond:
Rv Ibrahim, 2019 ONCA 631, at paras 92-95; but see R v Gager, 2020 ONCA274,
at paras 141-155

B, TRIAL JUDGE'S INTERVENTION IN PROCEEDING

For intervention in cross-examinations, see Evidence Law: Cross-Examination

‘The test for whether the trial judge's intervention rendered the trial unfair was
whether a reasonably minded person present throughout the trial would have
considered the accused had not had a fair trial: Av Colling, [2017] AJ No 1370
