646 Semi-Supervised Machine Learning

Machine learning that makes use of both labelled and unlabelled data during training.
(ISOMEC DIS 22989)

Note 1 : Descriptive information can be broader than just labelling. Annotation is the
process of attaching descriptive information to data, such as metadata, labels, or anchors
‘The data itself is unchanged in the annotation process

Note 2: Additional information about this term can be found in Section 7.4
6.7 Supervised Machine Learning

Machine learning that makes use of labelled data during training. (ISO/IEC DIS

Note 1: Descriptive information can be beoader than just labeling. Annotation isthe
process of ataching descriptive information to data, such as metadata, labels, or anchors
‘The data itself is unchanged inthe annotation process

Note 2: Additional information about this term can be found in Section 7.4
68 Test Dataset

A subset ofthe data that is never shown to the ML model during tai
‘hat the model has learned. (Modified from ISO/TEC DIS 22989)

1g, used to verify

69 Training

Process intended to establish or to improve the parameters of a machine learning model,
based on a machine learning algorithm, by using taining data. (Modified from ISO/IEC
DIS 22989)

6.10 Training Dataset
Subset of input data samples used to train a machine learning model. (ISOIMEC DIS 22989)
6.11 Unsupervised Machine Learning

‘Machine learning that makes use of unlabelled data during training. (SOMMEC DIS 22989)

Note I : Descriptive information can be broader than just labelling. Annotation is the
process of attaching descriptive information to data, such as metadata, labels, or anchors.
