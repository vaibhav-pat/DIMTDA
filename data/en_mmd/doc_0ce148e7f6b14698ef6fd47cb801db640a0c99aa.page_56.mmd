Anchor reaction of synchronous machines.
‘The method of two reactions that Blondel created
‘The stator current creates a magnetic flux called the “anchor reaction flux”, Must re-
alled the " anchor"
‘The current of the winding stator creates a magnetic field. The direction of this field
depends on what kind of load the nature of the generator works: inductive load, capacitive
load or active load.

‘member that in synchronous machines the stator is

‘The Descartes coordinate system for synchronous machines is inconvenient. Therefore,
Blondel suggested using a different coordinate system. He proposed using the two axes d
and q. Between these axes there are always 90 electrical degrees. Therefore, all processes in
the machine can be shown only for two poles, fig. 4.12.

‘The number of pole pairs is:
p= pe2

So it’s easier to understand: The axis d is directed along the axis of the rotor poles; this,
is the longitudinal axis. And the g-axis is perpendicular to the axis of the rotor, this is the
transverse axis.
