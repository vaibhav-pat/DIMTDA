COSTS AS A REMEDY

A. JURISDICTION TO AWARD COSTS

‘A provincial court hearing a CDSA forfeiture application has an implied power to
‘award costs in appropriate circumstances. That power is derived from the authority,
possessed by every court of law, to control its own process. It is also implied by
the forfeiture provisions of the CDSA: A v Fercan Developments, 2016 ONCA
269 at paras 49-55

‘A superior court has the ability to award costs pursuant toils power to contol its
‘own process. That power is part of a superior court's inherent jurisdiction,
‘A superior court can order parties to pay costs for frivolous or abusive proceedings
cr in cases involving misconduct: Fercan Developments at para 50

bifurcation of proceedings, requiring Itigants to seek a costs remedy in superior
court for a proceeding that occurred in the provinclal court: Fercan
Developments at para 58

‘The general rule is that no costs are awarded in a proceeding under the Provincial
Otfences Act: R v Topol, 2021 ONCA 217, at para 5
