‘The Johnston Community School Foundation (JCSF) plays an
important role within our schools by providing funding for projects,
that otherwise may never happen — projects that support and
enhance our legacy of excellence in education.

Since 2001, our foundation has awarded over $590,000 to fund
innovative programs that better educate students in each of our
schools, across all grade levels, and we couldn't have done it without
the generosity of donors like you.

Your gift to the Johnston Community School Foundation is an
investment in both our children and the future of our community.

We would like to ask for your help as a 2018 sponsor.

‘This is a great opportunity for your company to receive exposure
while supporting a worthy cause, We have two major fundraising
events in 2018 and are offering several levels of sponsorship for your
consideration,

Please consider supporting the Foundation. Thank you for your
support
