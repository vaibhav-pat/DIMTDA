Graph 4: Percentage Improvement of Agility performance for each subject in the Trusox,
â€˜compared with the Football Sock

Percentage Difference over two tas

Graph 4 shows a range improvement of the Trusox against the Football Sock of 16.8 -

30.9%, with an average time (s) improvement of 25.5%,

It was not initially the aim of this study to investigate factors that contribute to such
potential degree of percentage improvements in the Trusox for each subject (graph 4).
However, itis apparent that when each individual trial (26 trials) for the Trusox is ranked
quickest to slowest from Table 2 and separated into two groups with group 1
incorporating the first 1-13 fastest times and group 2 incorporating the slowest times
across all tests, from 14-16, there is a general trend that has immerged.
