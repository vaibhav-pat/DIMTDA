Introduction

Purpose and when to use this document
WaterAid's mission is to transform the lives of the poorest and most marginalised
people by improving access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). We
work with partners and influence decision-makers to maximise our impact.

Working in partnership with a wide range of organisations is central to WaterAid's
‘approach. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for developing a
‘specific type of partnership agreement ~ a Project Partnership Agreement - that is
fit for purpose, supports mutual accountabiliy and can be understood by all
concerned.

A Project Partnership Agreement must be in place when WaterAid is working
together with a Project Partner to deliver a specific, ime-bound Project. A Project
Partner:

‘© Isa partner with whom we will deliver a specific, time-bound project, funded
by a restricted grant, contract or other restricted or unrestricted funding
modality.

+ Usually receives funds from WaterAid for the purposes of delivering the
project, in line with their roles and responsibilties within the project.

‘+ Typically operates downstream of WaterAid, or as a Sub when WaterAid is
a Prime,

‘+ Is typically (though not always) named in a restricted funding proposal to a
donor.

‘+ Is typically involved for the duration of the project as opposed to a Service
Provider who is involved for a short period to deliver time-bound
deliverables (e.9. construction of a hand-washing block).

‘+ Would not normally be a Service Provider within the same project.

‘© Can also be, but does not need to be, committed to a long-term strategic
partnership MoU with WaterAid.
