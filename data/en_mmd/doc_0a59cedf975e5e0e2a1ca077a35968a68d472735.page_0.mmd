‘The Board discussed the formation of the Founders Fund. There will be a
separate Guild account for this Fund. A standing committee of 3 at large
members of the Guild will be formed. The committee will advise and assist
the Board with decisions about allocation of funds. For continuity, terms on
this committee will be staggered with members serving either a 1, 2 or 3
year period. (Note: the original wording of the proposal stated that 2 Board
members and 1 member at large would serve on the committee. A motion to
revise the phrasing to 3 at large members serving on the committee was
accepted and passed.)

A thank you note with receipt will be sent to Dick Witter for his gift to the
Guild of Joan's wheel. Paul Stokstad will keep track of motions made at
Board meetings to which will be posted on the website at the end of FY
2022-2023.

(On behalf of the Education committee, Barb Sears presented a
comprehensive report comparing prices for adult pottery classes in the
Lansing area. The Education committee recommended that the cost of Guild
classes be increased by $10 to $275 per class. Instructor fees will be increased
to $1100 effective January 2023. A motion to approve the raise in class
prices and instructor fees was accepted and passed. The Education committee
also recommends that the current schedule of lab hours for students remain
in effect.
