away, church is maybe like 4 miles away — so almost every day
you're awake, you are walking.

ALEX: Right. Four miles! Did you have to walk four miles to get
to school?

BENTON: Yeah, but that’s why we don't need gyms, right?
ALEX: Yeah!

BENTON: Your built-in exercise. And then, you are basically
carrying food or you're carrying whatever else, and while you are
walking you are singing, it's a part of what is so natural ina
particular sense, for me. So.

ALEX: Do you have a memory of one walk, and maybe
something that happened on that walk?

BENTON (laughs) Basically right, you are talking about living in
villages and all that, where you may not have any buses to go to
the big city. So, you would have people sometimes walk 20 miles
from one place, like for instance, if you are sick. If you are really
sick, you may have to walk from your village to the main road to
get to the town — that could be 20 miles. | remember like, for
instance, when | was young, and | think my grandmother was
taking me to the dentist — and like, we have never really seen a
big main road with all these cars passing by basically, so quickly,
and | think we were walking on side of the road, and this truck
came by, and we were sort of blown into the bushes — (/aughs)
with the wind from the truck, you know, so basically, all of a
sudden we were walking, and all of a sudden we find ourselves
(laughs)... litle things like that, you know, litle things like that.
You know, sometimes, you go back in your memory, and it's
basically things that reconnect you to the aspect of your family,
or just, in a sense, the journey from where you are then to now —
and the fact that you know, | have been in this country about 22
years — and sometimes how far removed I feel from that history
