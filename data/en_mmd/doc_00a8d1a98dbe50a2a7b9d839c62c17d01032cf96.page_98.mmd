P, RETRIALS (FOLLOWING MISTRIAL)

Section 653.1 provides that, in the case of a mistrial, previous rulings relating to
the disclosure or admissibility of evidence or the Charter are binding on the parties
inany new tral, “unless the court is satistied that it would not be in the interests of

trial, Instead, it creates a “presumption” that evidentiary rulings made at a prior

gives the trial judge a discretion. He or she must exercise that discretion, having

‘The prima facie rule is that where the essence of the case for the Crown is that the
persons charged were engaged in a common enterprise, they should be jointly
indicted and jointly tried

‘This general rule applies notwithstanding 1) the possibilty of cut-throat defences;
2) the possibilty of highly prejudicial evidence being admitted in respect of a co-
accused (e.9., gang-related evidence that might taint the accused).

‘An appellate court should not intervene in a trial judge's decision whether to sever
accused unless itis satisfied that the judge “acted unjudicially or that the ruling
