Title of Report

In your digital invites, provide a document that lists the order of each
part of the service so that neurodiverse people can prepare ahead.

Provide a plain-text version of the e-invite. Overstimulating materials
can be distracting, distressing, and may cause seizures.

List an option on your e-invite materials for low-sensory experiences,
such as live streaming rather than attending the in-person service or
having a low-sensory space (sensory rooms) within the building. Make
sure ushers know where the sensory rooms are located. Be sure to
announce the availability and location from the pulpit.

If physical invitations are used, avoid glitter and scented stationery.
