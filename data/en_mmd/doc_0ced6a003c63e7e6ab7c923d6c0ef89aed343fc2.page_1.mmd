A pilot plant can be used for

+ Evaluating the results of laboratory studies and making product and process
corrections and improvements.

+ Producing small quantities of product for sensory, chemical,
microbiological evaluations, limited market testing or furnishing samples
to potential customers, shelf-live and storage stability studies,

+ Determining possible salable by-products or waste stream requiring
treatment before discharge.

+ Providing data that can be used in making a decision on whether or not to
proceed to a full-scale production process: and in the ease ofa positive
decision, designing and constructing a full-size plant or modifying an

existing plant,

Considerations in pilot plant development

+ Kind and size ~ depends on goals: evaluating product and process:
producing samples of product for evaluation; market testing or furnishing
to potential customers.

+ Location: near R&D facility? At an existing plant? Close liaison between
R&D and pilot plant statis essential

+ Labor requirements and costs: engineering staf, skilled operations and
maintenance staf- pilot plant costs may exceed those of usual plant
production costs. The pilot plant may be used for training personnel for a

full- scale plant.

Objective
â€˜To ty the process on a model of proposed plant before committing large sum of
money on a production unit,
+ Examination of the formula to determine it's ability to with stand
Batch-scale and process modification.

+ Evaluation and Validation for process and equipments,
