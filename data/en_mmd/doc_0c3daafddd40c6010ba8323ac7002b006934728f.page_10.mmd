Title of Report

“We welcome and support children, teens, and adults with disabilities and
mental health conditions, as well as their families and caregivers. We make
every effort to ensure our programs, equipment, and facilities are
accessible, Please phone or email us if you have any questions or would like
to request a disability accommodation.”

Additional language may be added to state that requests for
accommodations made after the advertised date will be honored only to the
extent feasible.

Accessible Prayer Materials
Provide digital service materials in advance. Attach digital documents in
advance to allow blind or low-vision people to familiarize themselves with
the material prior to events and services. Access to digital materials
beforehand can help neurodivergent people prepare for the service itself,
easing anxiety and helping with focus.

+ Have large print and Braille materials available.

+ Braille prayer materials are often difficult to obtain and typically must
be requested by blind or low-vision persons themselves. Offer
support for members of your community who face these barriers and
remind them that they are a valued member of your community.

+ Some people may not be able to turn the pages. Attach sticky tabs to
every page you will be using to make it easy for individuals to turn
pages.

+ Both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint provide accessibility
assessments of materials. More information can be found here:
