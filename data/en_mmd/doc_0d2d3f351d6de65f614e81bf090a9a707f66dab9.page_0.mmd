‘Middle Barton policy on charging for and remissions for schoo! activities

Middle Barton School believes that all children are entitled fo an education regardless of race,
gender or disability. All our pupils should also have an equal opportunity to benefit from school
activities and visits (curricular and extra curricular) independent of their parents’ financial
means. This charging and remissions policy describes how we will do our best to ensure a
{good range of visits and activities is offered and, at the same time, try to minimise the financial
barriers which may prevent some pupils taking full advantage of the opportunities.

‘The 1996 Education Act requires all schools to have a policy on charging and remissions for
‘school actives, which will be Kept under ragular review. The review date for this policy is

recorded at the end of the document.

1. The policy identifies activities for which:

charges will be made
‘charges will not be made.
charges may be waived

2. Voluntary contributions.

voluntary contributions may be requested

Separately fram the matter of charging, schools may always seek voluntary
contributions in order to offer a wide variely of experiences to pupils. All requests for
voluntary contributions will emphasise their voluntary nature and the fact that pupils
‘of parents who do not make such contributions will be treated no differently from

those who have.
