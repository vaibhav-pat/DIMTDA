Bible Readings:
Corinthians 12: 12-13 & 25-26

Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many
parts form one body, so itis with Christ. "For we were all
baptized by"! one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews
or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit
to drink. 5So that there should be no division in the body, but
that its parts should have equal concern for each other. ?1f
one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is
honoured, every part rejoices with it

John 13: 34-35,
>" new command I give you: Love one another. As | have

loved you, so you must love one another. **By this everyone
will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”

Sermon: ‘Building each other up’

Let's think about what our social life in Great Britain would
have been without the vital work of ‘essential workers’ such as
teachers, nurses, medical doctors, health visitors... Let’s also
think about the fantastic contribution of thousands of
volunteers who have become more creative in their assistance
to others. Here, | think of the commendable work and
campaign of the young Black footballer Marcus Rashford,
together with the Late Sir Captain Tom Moore and many
others..

Likewise, as we have just read in 1Corinthians 12, the Christian
community is viewed by St Paul like ‘One body’, where ‘there
may be no dissension within the body, but the members may
have the same care for one another. If one member suffers,
all suffer together with it; if one member is honoured, all
rejoice together with it (1Corinthians, 12: 26-27). What is at
stake here is how through our togetherness and our
interdependence, we can empower one another. As our Lord
Jesus Christ said in Matthew 7: 12: In everything do to others
