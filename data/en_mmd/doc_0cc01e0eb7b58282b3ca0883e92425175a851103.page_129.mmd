Exhausted? No, I’m... Yes, I think I’m exhausted but
what true daughter of the stage sleeps?

TENNESSEE
Sure! Now we’re talking! Use that drive and just read
it.

DIANA
Oh, with pleasure...! Am I driven or am I exhausted?
TENNESSEE
Surprise me!
DIANA

(terrified) “Face it—pitiful monster... Of course, I
know I’m one too. But one with a difference. Do you
know what the different is? No, you don’t know. I’Il
tell you. We are two monsters”... “We are two
monsters”... “We”... “But with this difference
between us. Out of the passion and torment of my
existence... | have created a thing that I can unveil, a
sculpture, almost heroic, that I can unveil, which is
true. But you? You’ve come back to the town you
were born in, to a girl that won’t see you because you
put such rot in her body she had to be gutted and
hung on a butcher’s hook, like a chicken dressed for
Sunday.” (off his reaction) I can do it again.
