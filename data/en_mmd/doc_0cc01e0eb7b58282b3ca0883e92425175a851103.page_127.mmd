TENNESSEE
Read whatever I gave you. You were probably too
old for Princess. How old are you?

DIANA
Thirty-eight.
TENNESSEE
Thirty-eight?! You’re so young! Princess is, what—?
DIANA

I’m well old enough in actress years. This is the right
time for me. I... relate to her, Mr. Williams.

TENNESSEE
Don’t relate to my female characters; please can this
stop being a thing?

DIANA
Oh, certainly!
TENNESSEE
Don’t agree with me.
DIANA
Right!
TENNESSEE

You want to read for Princess? (getting new sides)
Blow me out of the water.
