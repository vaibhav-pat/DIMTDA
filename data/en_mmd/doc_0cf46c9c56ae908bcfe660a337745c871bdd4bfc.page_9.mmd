+ The purpose of having Four Focused Discussions is to provide schoo!
leadership teams with the opportunity to have facilitated, focused discussions about
the school's school-wide family engagement practices and to prepare for the
Partnerships for Literacy process.

+ tis intended to be a “pre-thinking” time for school teams. Setting aside time to
think about family engagement and literacy - about what we currently do and about
what is possible. It is not meant to be an overly formal process, but rather a time to
pause and think together before jumping in. The number of discussions, four, is not
set in stone. School teams should use the resources in this guide, the facilitation
support of their Family Engagement Lead, and their time in the way that suits their
needs to complete the pre-thinking discussions.
