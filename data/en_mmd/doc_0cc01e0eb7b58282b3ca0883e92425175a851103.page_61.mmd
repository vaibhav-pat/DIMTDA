DR. McCORVEY
Did you think we wouldn’t notice? I’m so furious I
could make out with you!

NURSE
Thought you could slip that your arm has a pulse
right by us, huh?

JANE
Yeah, it has a pulse! It’s an arm! If we don’t have

procaine we need WD-40 and a latex glove! Let’s
move, people! This thing’s weighing me down!

DR. McCORVEY
What’s next? I run down the street cutting off
everyone’s arms?

NURSE
You're not taking my arms.

JANE
What? No! Just this—I want this one gone! It looks
like it has a final boss track mark!

NURSE
It has a pulse!

JANE
I’m giving it a pulse—I am not discussing this until I
have an anesthesiologist present.
