Okay, let me look... (frowning at Machine) Uh..
only have one more memory with just you two.

TENNESSEE

That’s bullshit.

EDWINA
Hey...! Now look here: there’s still one with just you
two.

TENNESSEE
One...?
EDWINA
You wanna go?
TENNESSEE

No! Have you not figured out that the random bits
I’m remembering was ‘cause it was too fucked up to
forget!?

EDWINA
Language! We'll skip through the sniff-sniff—‘cause
the kids don’t need to see that—and just jump an
hour! Frank’s still here and we get our stars in! Who
wins? Everybody wins!

TENNESSEE
You don’t get it! This isn’t a good memory. This is
where... I am not meeting him.
