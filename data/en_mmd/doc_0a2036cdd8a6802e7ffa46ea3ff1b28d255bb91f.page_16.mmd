Appendix B: Continuous Labor Support

Continuous labor support is an evidence-based intervention shown to shorten labor,
‘along with other benefits. In 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of
the literature on continuous support for laboring women.’ The review included twenty:
{wo trials involving 15,288 women. This systematic review found that continuous labor
‘support is associated with the following benefits:

+ Greater incidence of spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 1.08, 95% confidence
interval (Cl) 1.04 to 1.12).

+ Lower rates of intrapartum analgesia (RR 0.90, 95% Cl 0.84 to 0.96).

+ Greater maternal satisfaction (RR 0.69, 95% Cl 0.59 to 0.79).

+ Shorter labor (MD -0.58 hours, 95% Cl -0.85 to -0.31).

+ Lower rates of cesarean (RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.67 to 0.91).

+ Lower rates of instrumental vaginal birth (lixed-effect, RR 0.90, 95% Cl 0.85 to
0.96).

+ Lower rates of regional analgesia (RR 0.93, 95% Cl 0.88 to 0.99).

«Fewer cases of low five-minute Apgar scores (fixed-effect, RR 0.69, 95% Cl 0.50
100.95),

Labor support didn't appear to affect any other intrapartum interventions, maternal or
neonatal complications, or breasteeding. The review found that continuous support had
the greatest positive effect when provided by a person outside of the laboring woman's
family or social group, and not a member of the hospital staf."®
