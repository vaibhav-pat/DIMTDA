how to look fori ight?

GRACE:
Aso i's a way to sort of showcase just how much work went into what they were doing

JARRAH:
‘Yeah, | do think it was worth i for this movie. Even though, you know, it took longer to release
and everything. | think it showed what's possible, and | realy noticed it actually watching it on
the Blu ray at home because Im more used to watching SD DSA at home and | was like "Wow
this looks a lot better.” Whereas atthe theater | just kind of took i for granted a bit. But yeah, it
looks really good and yeah. Wish it would happen, doesn’ look lke i's gonna happen that wore
‘gonna get released a full remaster but-

GRACE:
‘We're allowed to dream.

JARRAH:
‘We're alowed to dream

| mean the thing that makes me doubtful about the fll remaster, is that yes some people would
purchase it, but not as much as al those years ago when they fully remastered the original
GRACE:

‘Yeah probably not right, sad,

SUE:
Because of streaming.

JARRAH:
‘Yeah. And you know that not enough fans care enough to watch: to like seek out the HD
version. But I don't know, I mean maybe if copyright laws weren’ so ridiculous at some future
date we'd ust have some enterprising individuals who could remaster the whole thing in ke
‘and make it available.

GRACE:
Excellent usage of the word enterprise in there.

JARRAH:
‘Yes. That said, that's not gonna happen in our lifetime. “all laugh* Not gonna happen
