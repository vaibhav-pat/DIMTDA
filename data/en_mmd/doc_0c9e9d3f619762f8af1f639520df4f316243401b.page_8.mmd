42 Frequency bands currently identified for IMT
the following frequency bands are identified for IMT in the Radio Regulations (RR) Edition
2012. This identification does not preclude the use of these bands by any application of the services to
Which they ate allocated of identified and does not establish priority in the Radio Regulations. I should

oted that different regulatory provisions apply fo each band and that Regional deviations for each
are described in the different footnotes applying in each band, as shown in Table below
