The specialist fine-tuning or
‘voicing’ of the organ pipes has
completed the maintenance
work and returned the organ to
its optimum performance.

Itis therefore of particular
significance that the restoration
grants from the Heritage
Lottery Fund and The John
Pilling Trust have allowed Clive
Church to re-commission the
firm who was involved in the
original manufacture and
installation in 1887. Henry
Willis & Sons transported the
organ pipes and pedalboard
back to their Liverpool works
for restoration. With the
support of the Shropshire
Historic Churches Trust,
Treasure and Sons of Ludlow
adjusted the original carved

screen to improve access for
modern organists.

It is hoped that this timely
intervention will ensure that
our Willis organ will continue to.
serve the community for
another 130 years.
