and the treasures of the royal palace. He carried
off everything.” — 1 Kings 14:25 and 26

Redford: The importance of this in fixing one of the earliest
ates, specific dates in which Egyptian history coincides with
lory is really startling and has to be taken note of.?

N: This stunning convergence between the Bible and
Egyptian history gives a firm date for the death of Solomon.
Shishak’s campaign, according to the well-established
Egyptian chronology dates to 925 BC. And the Bible says,
Solomon dies five years earlier, which means 930 BC. This
s further evidence that David and Solomon lived in the tenth
century. But there’s even more hidden in these walls. These
ovals with their depictions of bound captives and city walls
represent places Pharaoh Shishak conquered in Israel. One
of those places is Gezer, where archaeologists find the
hallmark of Solomon’s building program, a six-chambered
gate.!° Bill Dever directed the excavations in the late 1960’s.

Dever: We can actually see vivid evidence here of a
destruction, Down below we have the original stone, pretty
much in situ; but if you look in here you can see the stones
are badly cracked; you can even see where they’re burned
from the heat of a huge fire that had been built here. And up
in here you can see that the fire had been so intense that the
soft limestone has melted into lime, and it flows down like
lava. This is vivid evidence of a destruction, and we would
connect that with this well-known raid of Pharaoh Shishak.

N: And if the gate was destroyed by Shishak in 925 BC; then

must have been built during the lifetime of Solomon, who
died just five years earlier.

Dever: Surely this kind of monumental architecture is
evidence of state formation. And if it’s in the tenth century,
then Solomon."!
