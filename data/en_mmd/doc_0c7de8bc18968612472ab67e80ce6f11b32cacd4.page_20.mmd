MORAL BAYESIANISM

the intercept and fi represents the fixed effect of atitude (three levels: belief, desire, and moral
judgment). Each attitude has its own scale parameter, The seale parameter of each group
comes from a gamma distribution that has mode © and standard deviation a, so that each
group's scale i estimated separately and is vague on the scale ofthe data (Kruschke, 2015),
‘The third parameter of thet isteibution is v. When vis more than 30, the distebution is normal
thus, we require thatthe prior of v give equal opportunity to small values ov (Les than 30) and
larger values ofv (greater than 30), To capture this, the prior of v was exponentially distibuted

from 1 to inf

yy With a mean of 30 (Krusehke, 2013; 2015). Note that since this is a novel
approach tothe study of moral judgements, no previous studies assess the parameters. Therefore,

we chose uninformative parameters aligned with Kruschke's suggest

(2015). The

description of the parameters of the model are provided in Figute 2.
