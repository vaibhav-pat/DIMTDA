RESTRICTED

Ch Supt Vicki White (VW) outlined the key areas within the NPAS performance
report:

Aircraft availability during April and July was on a par with this time last year
(69.5% average over the year) and now at 68.6% which is a slight drop but an
improving picture from February 2021 onwards. VW advised the performance
reporting will be amended going forward to reflect the 12hr and 20hr operating
bases;

Technical availabilty varies month on month predominately due to the age of
the fleet and the differing requirements;

Availably of pilots has been affected due to challenges with Covid, annual leave
‘and realignment to bases but should start to show an improvement from
September onwards:

‘Attendance has increased from 41.2% to 48% but this is against a backdrop of
decreasing numbers of requests;

76% of cancellations are before take-of

NPAS are looking at the number of internal flying hours as this is higher than
predicted due to an increase in raining for new TFOs to ensure the bases have
the sufficient number of TFOs trained for operational use;

Pt attendance is now measured from receipt of request 10 deployment
