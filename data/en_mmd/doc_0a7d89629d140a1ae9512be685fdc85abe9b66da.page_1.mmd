3. CRITICAL SITES
Ctcal sites are those habitats that may have a key role for the conservation status of a shark
population, and may include feeding, mating, pupping, overwintering grounds and other
aggregation sites, as well as corridors between these sites such as migration routes. Critical sites
have not been accurately defined for these species in all areas, but some potentially important
‘grounds have been proposed REFS.

4. POPULATION STATUS AND TRENDS
Information available on the population status and trends in this taxon consists of fisheries catch
ata analyzed in a generalized linear modeling approach and stock assessments. RFMOs
assessing siky shark are examining stocks in the Paciic and Indian Ocean IOTC to be
‘undertaken in 2019. Stock units have not been defined in the Pacific Ocean. The currant IUCN
Fld List status forthe global populations of siky shark is Vulnerable (Rigby et al. 2017)’.
