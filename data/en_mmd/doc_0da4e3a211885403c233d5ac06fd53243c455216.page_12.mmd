The UIL Eligibility Cycle

The new cycles affect UIL (Univesity Interscholastic League) eligibility check points. t's not as simple as
equating a report card with eligibility in the fal. On the old six-week grading calendar, the first report card (at
six weeks) determined whether a student was eligible to participate in UIL sports and activities. On a nine-week
calendar, the six-week etigibility/progress report is used to determine whether a student is eligible for UIL.
It's critical that students do nt wait to turn in assignments and have zeros onthe books at six weeks because
this wil affect their UILeigibiity. For UIL purposes, the six-week progress report ofthe first grading cycle
has the full force and weight ofa report card.

nthe nine-week calendar, the first report card, just three weeks ater the six week progress report, also
counts to determine UIL eligibility. After that, the only time a student can lose eligibility is when the report
cards are issued approximately nine weeks apart. On the nine-week calendar, students can lose UIL eligibiity
up to five times a year (the six week progress report plus four report cards) On asix week calendar, students can
lose UIL eligibility up to six times a year (six report cards),

Students who have lost UIL eligibility can regain their eligibility about every three weeks by showing they are
passing their courses on either a progress report or a report card.
