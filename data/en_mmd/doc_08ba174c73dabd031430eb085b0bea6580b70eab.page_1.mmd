Sample MEI resource

‘Solving Trigonometric equations’ (which can be found at
hitps:/imy.integralmaths.org/integral/sow-resources.pho) is a card sort activity which
is designed to support students in developing confidence in solving trigonometric.
‘equations which require the use of trigonometric identities. Students can work in
pairs to creale worked solutions, leading to opportunities to discussing links between
algebraic and graphical approaches to solving trigonometric equations. There are
{our sets of four equations. These vary in difficulty and each set focuses on different
algebraic skills or subject knowledge.

Effective use of technology

“Three trig graphs! (which can be found at hitp:ww.mel.ora.uklintegrating-
technology) is designed to enable students to see the link between the unit circle and
the graphs of trigonometric functions.

+ If is the moving point on the unit circle, why are its coordinates (cos sin a)?

+ Explain the key features of the graphs by referring to the geomettical
representation of the unit circle (e.g. why —1 < sina < 1, why tana is
undefined for « = 90°, periodicity, etc)

+ What can you tell me about sin 30° and sin 150°?
