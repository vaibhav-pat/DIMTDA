J\ Discovering Special Triangles J\

Today, you will be using what you know about triangles to look for patterns in special
triangles. With a partner cut out the triangles you've been given and complete the questions
below.

41. What type of triangles are they? How do you know?

2. Take the largest triangle label al he side lengths and angle measures.
Side lengths: Angle measures:

3. Fold the triangle in halt, and cut along the fold. You now have two congruent
triangles, one for you and one for your partner. What are the measures of each of
the angles? Label them on your triangle.

‘Smallest angle: Middle angle: Largest angle:

4, What is the length of each of the sides? List them in exact values below, and
label them on your triangle.

‘Smallest side: Middle side: Largest side:

'5. Repeat this process for the remaining two triangles. Fill in the tables below.

‘Smallest | Shortest | Middle | Middle | Largest Largest
angle _| side angle | side angle _| side
