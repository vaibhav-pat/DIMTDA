3. Let's repeat the laws of Kirchhoff and Ohm.

1) The first law of Kirchhoff. The algebraic sum of currents in the electrical circuit
node is 0.

2) The second law of Kirchhoff. The algebraic sum of EMF and voltage in an electri-
cal circuit is 0.

3) Ohm's law for a section of an electrical circuit /=—,A or U=1-R,A

where: — EMF of the voltage source, V; ~ current in the circuit, A;
— resistance of all external elements of the circuit, Ohm:
— internal resistance of the voltage source, Ohm.
In addition, you should know:
Active power P = m-U-I-cosg, W.
Active power is needed for work and for losses
Reactive power Q = m-U-L-sing, var.
Reactive power is needed to create magnetic fields.
where m — is the number of phases,
